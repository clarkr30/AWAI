01:14:27 - The Wech: 14ish is always fine for me on modpacks
01:14:28 - ZOUMUSHI: i saw the retweets jelly
01:14:30 - GhostVvar: 16 is the most you need
01:14:31 - The Revenant of Rage: 48GB is maybe way too much
01:14:32 - Legato: furry Jelly is best Jelly!
01:14:32 - garlic boi: pretty sure allocating too much ram to minecraft can cause memory leaks, so its one of the only games that can get worse with more ram lol
01:14:33 - Mono: The main problem with allocating too much ram involved the dumb java garbage collector
01:14:36 - AbhChallenger: Why do you even need to allocate ram? Does Windows not do that for you automatically?
01:14:40 - Sadment (Jester): Alice is fluffy
01:14:49 - supremeawesome: jelly when did you realize that you might be a furry?
01:14:52 - Robert Redgrave: im legit a furry and yea we're cursed asf
01:14:54 - PurplePeeps: 4 by 4 upto 16 tall
01:14:54 - Rem Forrest: She did like the furry art
01:14:58 - falconfrun: cute
01:15:00 - david martinez: just don't let the black Templar catch you Jelly
01:15:06 - The Revenant of Rage: Minecraft is a weird game with RAM usage
01:15:17 - Timshm: I wonder what keeb I should get with the keycaps. I already got what switches I am going to use.
01:15:25 - Shadowryuu: awawawawawa
01:15:41 - ChloroformDuck: Don't forget the valves and controller
01:15:52 - Gsun: 8gb its fine
01:15:56 - Caediae: Hii Jelly, I got your b day bundle those keycaps are so pretty

01:16:19 - MisterYura: hmmmmmmmmmm
01:16:20 - Rem Forrest: Cope
01:16:21 - Xylospring: Maybe 50GB of Jelly eating Chesborger
01:16:22 - david martinez: yeah that's not happening
01:16:22 - Robert Redgrave: wishful thinking
01:16:23 - Iago Le√£o: Humn, sure...
01:16:26 - Arthur: Omg, It's Jelly
01:16:27 - Sadment (Jester): they are good.....*proceed to save em*
01:16:27 - Caediae: You‚Äôre a furry?
01:16:28 - Zuhark: positive reinforcement will not work in this situation
01:16:32 - brandon: hmm
01:16:36 - F C: lol
01:16:36 - Jun „Ç∏„É•„É≥: shockingly accurate if Jelly were a furry
01:16:40 - Caediae: I thought you werent a furry Jelly
01:16:43 - TheSealeboy: JERRY
01:16:44 - The Revenant of Rage: Then explicitily say "Hey Furry me is pretty cool, can I be normal now?"
01:16:47 - Jun „Ç∏„É•„É≥: it's like a peak into the closet
01:16:48 - 420NoScope YeetCannon: lol
01:16:48 - rad: So good she set them as her wallpaper and backed them to every device
01:16:50 - Will Leong: but arent you a furry?
01:16:52 - david martinez: jelly you've met real people right?
01:17:08 - Rem Forrest: Jelly is a closet furry
01:17:11 - The Revenant of Rage: Coolio
01:17:22 - Sadment (Jester): what's she's making btw?
01:17:25 - coosome: Power it with solar panels
01:17:26 - Robert Redgrave: power through the allegations
01:17:29 - CallMeFox: X
01:17:31 - Fluffy MoonCat: uh
01:17:32 - Change_Z: your pc is not consider real people
01:17:32 - The Revenant of Rage: This might work, who knows
01:17:33 - supremeawesome: does sakana know that you're a furry jelly?
01:17:36 - Dharam: let's hope it counts lmao
01:17:39 - Arthur: idk if we count furries as "people"
01:17:46 - david martinez: then you should know people don't respond how you want them to be
01:17:48 - Dustycadet 158üëªü•ñ: Lol
01:17:50 - mihalick: I am not sure modded biomes would affect the effeciency
01:18:02 - Fluffy MoonCat: I mean it'll work but it means actual deserts
01:18:03 - Sadment (Jester): she making a fridge?
01:18:04 - Caediae: Jerry are those keycaps meant to be put on keyboards or are they novelty?
01:18:16 - Gsun: if i remember it also works even better in dimentions that are always day time
01:18:29 - The Revenant of Rage: Depends on whether the mod assigned a temperature or something to the biome
01:18:45 - Fluffy MoonCat: you can also use advanced solar panels from mekanism which do work better in cold biomes 
01:18:46 - rad: @Caediae Either or. I'd suggest getting two for both purposes
01:18:52 - TheSealeboy: They used to make games. But not anymore
01:18:53 - Caediae: Is she making nukes‚Ä¶.? 
01:18:58 - PurplePeeps: use a heater to max it
01:18:59 - Dustycadet 158üëªü•ñ: I have no idea what's going on lol
01:19:14 - ChloroformDuck: No power
01:19:19 - mihalick: Thats around -10C
01:19:20 - Gsun: it needs water i think?
01:19:22 - gizmos and gadgets: The thermal evaporator requires heat to operate
01:19:23 - Dustycadet 158üëªü•ñ: Oh okay
01:19:26 - The Revenant of Rage: Just input water
01:19:32 - Caediae: Cute anime girl builds minecraft nukes
01:19:40 - themfofsouthbay: love ya bye
01:19:42 - yummy: advanced solar generators just make it faster. you can also add another valve and connect a heat generator I think
01:19:42 - The Revenant of Rage: Shouldn't need power
01:19:50 - coosome: the solar panels REALLY help
01:20:00 - gizmos and gadgets: Thermal evaporator needs heat and a proper fluid input to function. Use an inductive heater to speed things up.
01:20:08 - TheSealeboy: If you wanna make Lithium, you'll have to revive Kurt Cobain
01:20:13 - Rei Rei: awawawawa
01:20:42 - gizmos and gadgets: Jelly it also needs heat provided from inductive heaters or solar panels
01:20:47 - mihalick: You are gonna need a way to generate heat to make it work
01:21:01 - Dharam: love the fact that the sink just blends in
01:21:08 - Gsun: you can put solar panels on top
01:21:10 - GhostVvar: no
01:21:14 - Ashers: Yea, it looks like it's part of it xD
01:21:18 - The Wech: ah the good ol' sink
01:21:23 - gizmos and gadgets: Oh its resistive 
01:21:34 - gizmos and gadgets: Someone earlier said inductive
01:21:45 - Gsun: use brain
01:21:49 - GhostVvar: Resistive heaters are better short term
01:21:55 - gizmos and gadgets: Resistive heater allows for night time usage
01:21:57 - LowBudgetSlo: you dont need them
01:22:13 - F C: the jelly alarm
01:22:17 - mihalick: Those need power source
01:22:22 - The Revenant of Rage: Cold Desert isn't hot enough to evaporate, go figure
01:22:26 - Dustycadet 158üëªü•ñ: Hopefully
01:22:28 - GhostVvar: yes
01:22:37 - Knigh of the void: Shes blinked twice

01:22:51 - Gaonadier: its fairly straightforward
01:22:51 - Aynishard: if a boyscout can do it i'm sure you can
01:22:52 - Dharam: yeah that'd be so crazy haha why'd you even think that hahaha
01:22:53 - Arion: Jelly Stark made this in a cave!
01:23:01 - Ploffy35: Why you looking up is so cute
01:23:01 - Lord of Ashes: She keeps saying yes...
01:23:02 - dansaa: I thought you were a scientist, and you can't make a nuclear reactor? dropped
01:23:03 - GhostVvar: You only need one, you can adjust it's heat output
01:23:05 - The Revenant of Rage: Hi Mimi!
01:23:06 - KanashiiWolf: How can you call yourself a programmer if you can't make and run a nuclear reactor! 
01:23:07 - LowBudgetSlo: these work passivly the heater just makes it go faster
01:23:17 - Caediae: What does the nuke do?
01:23:27 - Lord of Ashes: nuh uhhh
01:23:30 - The Revenant of Rage: I think the degree transfers
01:23:35 - gizmos and gadgets: I think there are heat pipes that can transfer it from the heater to the multiblock
01:23:43 - gizmos and gadgets: No it‚Äôs not part of the multiblock
01:23:46 - shadowslayer205: Then why can't you make a nuclear reactor in minecraft?
01:23:50 - St.Feb_14th: I don't think it's part of the multiblock
01:23:50 - PurplePeeps: you put it on a valve
01:23:56 - The Revenant of Rage: Also, there are heat pipes
01:24:05 - gizmos and gadgets: The heat gets piped into the multiblock 
01:24:07 - GhostVvar: no, you need to use a thermal pipe
01:24:13 - Ploffy35: Windmills? What is this mod wow
01:24:35 - gizmos and gadgets: I think thermal pipes are needed to transfer the heat
01:24:43 - Winston Sassmanüå†üéÄ: PIPE
01:24:50 - gizmos and gadgets: But I think they can be directly attached
01:24:50 - SpoonCar: ‚ÄúVolve‚Äù
01:24:52 - St.Feb_14th: Oh jeez
01:24:55 - Legato: awawaw
01:24:57 - Kyli: awawawawawa
01:24:58 - ZOUMUSHI: AWAWAWAWAWA

01:25:32 - Ihsan TwentyOne: Because you are Hot Jelly. *rizzface
01:25:34 - tony: you should invest in wireless crafting
01:25:34 - PurplePeeps: thermal
01:25:40 - TheSealeboy: Remember that valves only work in series of 2. Valves don't like the number 3
01:25:41 - gizmos and gadgets: I think it‚Äôs inductive cable 
01:25:43 - The Revenant of Rage: Thermal
01:25:55 - Tom All Thumbs: JERRY!!! Sup chat
01:26:13 - Sunman: So pipe is needed or just cheese it?

01:30:34 - supremeawesome: I came back for a 5 min brake, so are we done calling jelly a furry?
01:30:47 - tony: you should try getting wireless crafting (wireless transmitter and wireless crafting grid)
01:30:53 - gizmos and gadgets: So a tip, your brine producing tower should be about 10x the height of your lithium producing tower for peak efficiency.
01:30:54 - Ploffy35: Chemistry class with Jelly

01:40:53 - Ranto Phantom: literally crafting 10 things to make crafting slightly easier lmao
01:40:58 - mihalick: I think making more transmitters and placing them around the place could work, but I might be wrong
01:41:17 - Lenny: is there no satellite ?
01:41:22 - gizmos and gadgets: Is there an infinity card?
01:41:26 - Fluffy MoonCat: there's a mod that adds an infinite range upgrade card
01:41:35 - PurplePeeps: is the infinite one not in this?
01:41:45 - Dustycadet 158üëªü•ñ: Darn
01:41:48 - The Revenant of Rage: As long as the transmitters are on the same network yeah
01:41:57 - The Revenant of Rage: Connect them all

04:16:19 - coosome: Check the wreck for chests & maps

04:16:21 - Neh: nah, helium is very safe
04:16:24 - Rossco: wasn't there a pixar movie about that?
04:16:25 - nnnik: It can contain maps to elytras
04:16:27 - Reluctant Reader: hoshiumiberg
04:16:29 - Akasora: It is possible just impractical to do with helium
04:16:34 - Jun „Ç∏„É•„É≥: well, you could use one BIG balloon too. like an air balloon

04:17:33 - Hutt E: ban
04:17:38 - Corn Enthusiast: Up Up
04:17:43 - Hutt E: right?
04:17:50 - The Revenant of Rage: Really hard to know where to look, I've never dealt with this astructure before
04:17:52 - Dharam: within the normal confines of the shuP?
04:17:53 - The Revenant of Rage: OOOH
04:17:54 - Corn Enthusiast: YES
04:17:55 - Dharam: *ship?
04:17:58 - GCxLife: is there nothing lieka vein mining mod or keybind?
04:17:58 - The Revenant of Rage: Potion Stand

04:18:28 - GCxLife: at the front
04:18:31 - Corn Enthusiast: Right side in that room
04:18:36 - GCxLife: but i doubt youll find a front
04:18:47 - Dharam: AYAYA
04:19:05 - bracerkun: Ayaya
04:19:08 - F C: AYAYA
04:19:09 - Diet Water: AYAYA

04:19:13 - The Bismarck: AYAYA
04:19:19 - The Revenant of Rage: Found the potion stand but not the chest
04:19:20 - GCxLife: yes
04:19:21 - Dharam: /s 
04:19:23 - Corn Enthusiast: Mine out the whole ship
04:19:25 - CallMeFox: AYAYA
04:19:25 - TomTrixxor: AYAYA
04:19:26 - Sun Stormer: if it's anything like vanilla still, it's usually the front of the ship
04:19:27 - Hobocron: AYAYA
04:19:32 - coosome: How much more search until we get another minecraft stream?
04:19:34 - Aexis Rai: I would suggest mining everything but the purpur so it keeps structure and you can orient inside it...
04:19:39 - Corn Enthusiast: Be thorough
04:19:44 - St.Feb_14th: Chests are like a lie they tell you to keep you down dude
04:19:45 - iannyaanyaa: no (idk im not the minecraft wiki)
04:19:48 - mihalick: I wouldn't bother at this point
04:19:52 - Vexxed Scyphozoa: Potion stand is at the back, on stairs going down. Chest would be opposite side and a little lower
04:19:54 - Sun Stormer: no
04:19:56 - Reluctant Reader: try strip mining
04:20:09 - nnnik: There isnt even an end portal in 100% of all strongholds so no...
04:20:09 - KoKoKen: the average viewer of a jelly stream doesnt care about chests anyways
04:20:12 - The Revenant of Rage: I would assume the whole point of this structure would be to have a chest
04:20:38 - Vexxed Scyphozoa: yes around there or not at all
04:20:39 - The Revenant of Rage: If they just added this structure cause it's cool, that's a shame
04:20:43 - Sun Stormer: yep 
04:20:50 - Aexis Rai: tongue 
04:20:56 - Dharam: @KoKoKen just pipes and reactors for us, tyvm
04:20:58 - Robert Redgrave: im freaking out cause you're playing minecraft tho
04:21:00 - AutoPbDelSys: jelly being 1 guyed, you luv to see it
04:21:04 - Neh: meaning there isn't one... that ship doesn't seem to have a front
04:21:05 - Shadowryuu: there is always the possibility for the generation to have a hickup and no chest spawning
04:21:10 - GCxLife: have you seen inside of an endship before?
04:21:13 - Neh: this one does!
04:21:14 - Chi: The point of the structure is to look cool, and it does look cool

04:22:37 - Wesley F: rip
04:22:42 - Aexis Rai: myan
04:22:42 - bracerkun: Maybe the Jelytra were the friends we made along the way
04:22:43 - mihalick: Leave something in the chest for some other unlicky soul
04:22:59 - Jun „Ç∏„É•„É≥: maybe the real chest is the adventure we had together along the way 
04:23:19 - StrelitziaüïäÔ∏èch.: i played this mod once and sometimes chests spawns too far from spawn tends to have nothing in it
04:23:21 - River: Caelid

04:24:07 - The Revenant of Rage: Doesn't even have 2 chests to scam you
04:24:09 - Dustycadet 158üëªü•ñ: Pain
04:24:21 - Akasora: Downsides of mods
04:24:26 - mihalick: You tried so hard and got so far, but in the End chests are always empty~
04:24:30 - GCxLife: awawawawawa
04:24:31 - –ì—É–≥–ª –ì–æ–≤–Ω–æ: wawawawa...
04:24:31 - Botch_Guy: I'm willing to bet Fishman looted the end.

04:24:40 - Camie-chan: awawawawa
04:24:41 - St.Feb_14th: Have you thought maybe the chests are a lesson about materialism? 
04:24:45 - Neh: down a little more?
04:24:47 - Retrograde Rustic: awawawawa?
04:24:47 - Dustycadet 158üëªü•ñ: Awawawawa

04:25:38 - bracerkun: Oh...
04:25:41 - Retrograde Rustic: lol
04:25:46 - Neh: All chests have the potential to be full of love and caring
04:25:46 - Dharam: Jelly requires milk in her chests
04:25:47 - Blo: How is the fuel 
04:25:48 - Foggyüå†: jelly...
04:25:49 - Botch_Guy: She hates dry hags!
04:25:51 - Worldend Dominator: Isn't every chest in minecraft flat?
04:25:52 - TomTrixxor: uhh ... right
04:25:54 - Shaggy Scooby: At what point are you so unlucky that it‚Äôs actually kind of lucky 
04:25:55 - Blo: This is giving me anxiety 
04:26:03 - Akasora: Well too bad for you because empty ones is all there are
04:26:07 - Dharam: NOTHING! 
04:26:10 - bracerkun: LMAO
04:26:11 - TomTrixxor: Nothing! 
04:26:13 - St.Feb_14th: NOTHING!
04:26:25 - Akasora: Probably glitched
04:26:27 - AirlineFood: to make you mald
04:26:28 - Babababa: the journey 
04:26:31 - Jun „Ç∏„É•„É≥: the chest is a metaphor about life
04:26:31 - GCxLife: either the loot got bugged or someone really cleared everything out to the brim
04:26:33 - mihalick: You got chat at least
04:26:37 - Dharam: yeah gotta be glitched
04:26:41 - david martinez: greed is bad
04:26:43 - –ì—É–≥–ª –ì–æ–≤–Ω–æ: expectations: subverted
04:26:47 - St.Feb_14th: It's about finding yourself Jerry
04:26:49 - Robert Redgrave: i like her lol
04:26:54 - Dustycadet 158üëªü•ñ: So deep
04:27:00 - Malcolm Liang: Greed is good
04:27:00 - The Revenant of Rage: Comfiest Minecraft ambience noises
04:27:04 - StrangerSeen: Philisophical greed 
04:27:05 - bracerkun: Materialism and Hubris is Bad
04:27:07 - Akasora: Look at the Brightside you don't get elytras from chests
04:27:09 - Aexis Rai: error noise ahh bgm
04:27:10 - GCxLife: WAIT I thought my headphones broke when I was playing the modpack
04:27:12 - david martinez: and the chests are the friends we made along the way
04:27:13 - Dharam: 11-minute final track off the 2nd volume of the OST
04:27:22 - Neh: I'd check an end city chest too. your server might be bugged to not fill the end chests with items. Why would every single container be empty out here?
04:27:36 - The Revenant of Rage: Wonder if the speed works with the Jetpack
04:27:45 - Dustycadet 158üëªü•ñ: Nooooooo not the meat
04:27:49 - Shadowryuu: VIOLENCE!
04:27:57 - The Revenant of Rage: Ooh, looks like it does
04:28:03 - Corn Enthusiast: Ruins back there
04:28:03 - Dharam: oh yeha, was there anything in the End City chests?
04:28:04 - Medaux: its ok probably their fault the chests were empty anyways 
04:28:14 - Shaggy Scooby: What was that behind her 
04:28:18 - Jackie: Jelly takes her anger on Black Men
04:28:19 - Malcolm Liang: How much RAM do you have?
04:28:25 - The Revenant of Rage: At least the Elytra spawns on a frame and not in a chest
04:28:27 - GCxLife: Idk if there is that really dark and laggy biome
04:28:29 - Aexis Rai: the chunks are churning
04:28:34 - Akasora: don't worry I've played with lower framerates 
04:28:41 - GCxLife: she allocated 11gigs hol
04:28:47 - Malcolm Liang: It's not using 50%
04:28:48 - The Revenant of Rage: So that doesn't really matter too much but still a good idea to check if anything spawns in chests
04:28:49 - mihalick: It should be good
04:28:51 - Dustycadet 158üëªü•ñ: Oh yeah I saw that
04:28:53 - Malcolm Liang: Should not be lagging
04:28:56 - Dharam: dedotated too hard 
04:28:56 - Wesley F: it's good
04:28:57 - Malcolm Liang: What's CPU temp?
04:28:58 - Medaux: is there such a thing as too much ram?
04:29:00 - Malcolm Liang: And GPU temp
04:29:00 - IRCraziestTaxi: maybe, just download more to be sure
04:29:02 - Shaggy Scooby: Time to download more 
04:29:05 - Dustycadet 158üëªü•ñ: Congratulations on the upgrade
04:29:06 - Malcolm Liang: If your GPU temp peak 100 degrees
04:29:07 - TomTrixxor: should be fine
04:29:08 - Malcolm Liang: It lags
04:29:11 - nnnik: Java 1.8 lol
04:29:13 - The Revenant of Rage: It's probably just Sakana server issues
04:29:24 - Malcolm Liang: CPU 100c = shut down, GPU 100c = fps drop
04:29:24 - Neh: that doesn't matter much. her computer isn't the one doing most of the work for the game, the server is.
04:29:30 - Babababa: nominmal
04:29:30 - Camie-chan: windows noises
04:29:33 - Reluctant Reader: it's chilling
04:29:33 - mihalick: 4070 shouldn't overheat in minecraft
04:29:37 - GCxLife: then probably mineraf being minecraf
04:29:38 - nnnik: Do you have sodium installed?
04:29:40 - Malcolm Liang: Is the server that bad?
04:29:44 - Akasora: I doubt is a RAM problem since you are playing in a server 
04:29:48 - bracerkun: Sakana.....
04:29:49 - Malcolm Liang: Get Sakana to upgrade it lol
04:29:51 - Botch_Guy: So it's the FISH.
04:29:56 - Dharam: the server being bad wouldn't cause FPS issues
04:29:56 - The Revenant of Rage: Sodium is a performance mod
04:29:59 - Kiwiblackberry: cool machine
04:30:00 - Dustycadet 158üëªü•ñ: Lol
04:30:00 - GCxLife: shes on forge im positive
04:30:00 - Malcolm Liang: It's like $15 a month?
04:30:01 - AirlineFood: FISHMAN! upgrade jelly private server!
04:30:02 - Babababa: NA
04:30:02 - Evanchoro: OF COURSE its the fish
04:30:08 - ThyDentar: I can't believe it was the fish
04:30:09 - Akasora: No sodium in forge
04:30:13 - The Revenant of Rage: Optifine is also another one
04:30:16 - bracerkun: It' just $15 a month Sakana....
04:30:17 - Akasora: Optifine is for forge
04:30:17 - ThyDentar: Sodium is for fabric
04:30:19 - Spero: optifine is dated, sodium is much better
04:30:19 - GCxLife: bro optifine is long dead lmao
04:30:19 - KoKoKen: wait has she been playing on the low performance new versions without the gigaperformance mods
04:30:21 - Malcolm Liang: t
04:30:22 - bracerkun: t
04:30:23 - The Revenant of Rage: There's more than just Optifine Jelly
04:30:23 - TheFunnsy: t
04:30:24 - nnnik: Optifine is trash in comparison to Sodium
04:30:24 - Medaux: t
04:30:27 - Aexis Rai: t
04:30:27 - Dharam: Optifine is old and kinda spaghetti code now iirc
04:30:40 - ThyDentar: optifine still gets updated lol
04:30:41 - Akasora: It;s not
04:30:45 - john smith: for real???
04:30:47 - bracerkun: Obsolete....
04:30:48 - Ranto Phantom: sodium is fabric only though jelly is playing forge which only have optifine or Rubidium which is a forge fork of sodium
04:30:52 - Akasora: Still needed for forge modpacks
04:30:52 - Jun „Ç∏„É•„É≥: if optifine is dead, I'm hella old 
04:30:59 - Foggyüå†: optfine breaks too many mods nowadays
04:31:01 - KoKoKen: all you need is optifog
04:31:02 - GCxLife: try rubidium if youre on forge its a sodium port for forge versions
04:31:03 - TomTrixxor: I also didn't know that ... what a shame
04:31:10 - Botch_Guy: I'm going to bed now, it's past 3am. Goodnight miners!

04:32:25 - brandon: Silk touch
04:32:25 - Shaggy Scooby: Always lol

04:32:58 - The Revenant of Rage: For Better End materials I think
04:33:03 - Akasora: not one of us 
04:33:04 - Dharam: this place is pretty but i also feel kinda uncomfortable
04:33:06 - Dustycadet 158üëªü•ñ: Jellys not a miner?
04:33:07 - Lapua Lazuli: Just got here. Did she nook the dragon yet?
04:33:32 - david martinez: yeah dragon dead
04:33:48 - Lapua Lazuli: Sounds like the End needs some freedom
04:33:52 - The Revenant of Rage: This looks new
04:33:54 - Dharam: @Lapua Lazuli heyo, yeah she did, but it was completely immune to the nuke so she just hacked at it a few times like normal

04:34:18 - Shaggy Scooby: Umbrella corporation has many companies under it 
04:34:19 - nnnik: With sodium + indium + nVidium people can get a render distance of 86 chunks. Optifine allows you maybe 2 render distance extra

04:35:25 - yanqui: weird cat noise
04:35:28 - Wesley F: have you tried using one of those online tools to find an end city?
04:35:29 - PenguinBacon: Can you not look up End City in a Nature's Compass

04:50:13 - Corn Enthusiast: Yeah that's just minecraft though
04:50:16 - Foggyüå†: sometimes it's OK to just jelly around a bit
04:50:18 - Retrograde Rustic: You determined that ender dragons are nuke-proof
04:50:26 - Lenny: so was the mech armor an upgrade or downgrade 
04:50:41 - F C: today we learned
04:50:51 - Lapua Lazuli: I wonder if Ender Dragons could survive reactor meltdowns
