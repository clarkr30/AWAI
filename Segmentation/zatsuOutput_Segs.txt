 No, two, three, three months ago, I think.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Yeah, I played it like before it even released on, on, on Steam.
 Because I guess they told us to not play it before the start date of the beta.
 And I played it anyways
<NEW_TOPIC>

and they forgot to restrict us from playing it.
 So I just played it.
 And then I just randomly got disconnected in the middle of the game.

So I had to play all the way from the beginning.
 Thank you.

 This is- this is exactly what happens when I don't have a plan.
 I'm giving younger sibling vibes right now.
 I'm an idol.
 I'm not a-I'm not your-I'm not your little sister.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

I can be- I can be your little sister though.
 I don't-I don't mind.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

I don't have a big brother.
 So, uh, I think being-I think-
 Every once in a while.

 Back to normal.
 Man, Jelly's stream looking like the 80s.
 Thank you, Paul- Paul Artis for nine months.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Why are we crowdfunding putting the job on Las Vegas Dome for a day?
 Thank you for the nine months!
 That'd be pretty funny, actually.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Isn't that- doesn't that cost, like, a more billion dollars?
 But anyways, I've been-
 I-I-
<NEW_TOPIC>

I-I-
<NEW_TOPIC>

I-I-I-
<NEW_TOPIC>

I- every, like- every, like, week.
 Like, at least once a week.
 I think about how nice it would be to have, like, a sibling.
 You know?
 Cause, like, you-
<NEW_TOPIC>

it's- it's basically like, uh, like, uh-
 Thank you, Santa Act 3 to 5!
 Ah!
 It's basically, like-
 I don't know.
 I just think it would be nice.
 Can you call-
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

No, I cannot call you the word.
 What the heck?
 No, I'm not-
 You're a weirdo!
 You know that?
 You're a weirdo and a weeb.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

I know I'm an anime girl on the internet, but you're a weeb.
 Thank you, Jupe, for the sofa!
 You really do give off an annoying little sister vibe.
 It just happens.
 It just happens.
 If only I had a doting big brother that-
 Uh-
 That, uh, called me annoying.
 And-
 Hung out with me.
 I guess.
 Since you'd be our little sister-
 I'm not-
<NEW_TOPIC>

I'm not calling-
 I ain't calling you big bro.
 Ew, that's disgusting.
 I don't want to do that anymore.
 I- I changed my mind.
 Pfft.
 Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
 Kind of calling the pot, Black.
 Yeah, I'm a hypocrite.
 So what?
 Thank you, David, for the 5!
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Welcome to my little sister-
 Can't possibly a job.
 What?
 What?
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

What?
 What?
 What?
 What?
 What?
 What?
 It's-
 It's not a brother complex.
 I don't mind a big sister either.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Then-
 Then she could do my nails and buy me-
 Buy me cute clothes.
 I just want somebody to be close with.
 Does that make any sense?
 I just want somebody to be close with-
 Is that too much to ask?
 I'm not into-
 You get your minds on the good air!
 You're weird.
 You're all weird.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Just because I want a-
 I want a sibling doesn't mean I'm into them, dude.
 You need a husband?
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 True.
 But it's probably more likely for me to get a big brother than to get a husband.
 You know that?
 Can you play 40k on your forehead?
 You can play Monopoly on my forehead.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

I-
 I-
 I don't mind a younger sibling either.
 You know?
 So I can buy them cute clothes.
 And stuff.
 And I can be strong for them.
 And I can teach them how to do things.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

And I can help them with your homework.
 And they'll look up to me.
 And-
 And-
 They'll look up to me.
 And I'll be-
 I'll be a cool big sister.
 You know?
 If you're a hypocrite.
 Would eating, mood, and be cannibalism?
 No comment.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

What if you treat your cousins like this?
 They're-
 They're like-
 I think me and my cousins, we're like too far away.
 You know?
 Because they're-
 They're like from the countryside.
 And I'm like-
 I'm like from the city.
 You know?
 I was brought up in the city.
 Or about the outskirts of the city.
 And I occasionally go back to the countryside.
 But I'm not like a countryside girl.
 You know?
 Thank you, Carsman Electro for the 7.
 No, you cannot!
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Yeah, the quote-unquote city.
 Dude, look.
 Cities are places with tall buildings.
 That's it.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

One skyscraper and the entire place becomes a city.
 Alright?
 I've been late to ask for a younger sibling at age 35.
 I'm not 35.
 What are they?
 Came to the city?
 Yeah, they came to the city last time.
 Like last time I was-
 Like just a couple weeks ago they were here.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

But like-
 I mean-
 I did spoil my younger cousin.
 Like the youngest one.
 A lot.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Like I bought her like a book and everything.
 And whatever like dumb thing she wanted.
 I'd be like,
 Okay, don't tell your mom.
 But I'll buy it for you.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Rhea did a big brother application strip.
 No, no, no.
 Dude, it's a different purpose.
 Okay.

Did your birthday pass?
 36?
 I'm not 36.
 And I'm not even 30.
 Yeah, anyways.
 Yeah, anyways.
 Like-
 It's not-
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

It's not the same feel.
 You know?
 It's-
 I can't-
 I can't be as close as they are with each other.
 You know?
 I think it could be.
 Jelly, can I have a $100 figure and order?
 Figure and order as a new banner?
 No, go buy it yourself.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

She lies as naturally as she breathes.
 Dude, I'm like-
 I'm 18.
 All right.
 Okay, I'm not actually 18.
 But I'm 18.
 Thank you, army.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

This is my obligation, Jelly Bean.
 No!
 No!
 I'm not-

 I'm forever 18.
 All right?
 I'll just-
 Just say-
 Let's just-
 Let's just say it.
 I'm eternally-
 I'm eternally-
 18 years old.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

And-
 What I sum up with my last super chat.
 Think about it, Sipa!
 How many seasons of 18?
 As many seasons as I want.
 Forever 18.
 Yeah, I'm eternally 18.
 So no booze?
 Yeah, man.
 I don't drink, man.
 I-
 I'm say-so, man.
 Like, I-
 I don't-
 I don't drink.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

I don't-
 I don't swear.
 I don't-
 I don't-
 I'm not racist.
 And I'm not sexist.
 And I'm not-
 Any-ist.
 I'm not-
 I love all people.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Can I be the emotionally absent big brother?
 Oh, yeah.
 Okay, sure.
 Yeah!
 I'm not-
 You was racist?
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

No, I just said I'm not racist.
 Then it shall be my application for Jelly-
 I'll think about it.
 I'll think about it.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

I'll put-
 I'll put-
 I'll put your-
 I'll take your, um, uh, things into consideration.
 Jelly is a normie?
 Dude, what?
 Dude, what?
 What did you-
 What do you mean by that?
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Being ra-
 Being not racist and sexist equals normie?
 What are you talking about?
 What do you mean by that?
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

So if I'm sexist and I'm racist, that means I'm not a normie?
 Daddy-car-man-a-2 cap?
 I don't have a hat right now.
 What do you said?
 What?
 That's-
 That's-
 That's crazy.

 That's crazy.
 Do you see a developer's response to all the hate?
 Like what?
 With what?
 What-
 What hate?
 With-
 With what?
 Dustborn?
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Let's not talk about Dustborn anymore.
 I don't want to get in more trouble.
 But you're older than Pippa?
 Dude, I don't even know how old Pippa is.
 I never asked.
 I know-
 I know how old, like, the other girls are.
 Actually, no, I keep forgetting.
 You know, I keep-
 I keep calling
 Dizzy, like, 30.
 And I don't even think she's 30,
 but like, in my head, she's like 30.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

You know, she's probably not 30.
 Oh, she's 3.
 Okay, okay.
 You mean that.
 All right.
 Yeah, she's 3.
 Thank you, Blazorama!
 But handsome.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

What?
 She's like 60.
 Dizzy's like 50?
 Dizzy's like 80?
 Okay, it's like the number's getting bigger.
 Number's getting bigger.
 I'm pretty sure you could accurately guess
 the ages of all FaZe members
 if you just, like,
 paid attention to their streams.
 I think you could all pretty accurately guess,
 like, the actual age.
 Unless you're, like, dumb,
 then I wouldn't know.
 Hack Connect?
 Okay, dude, we're not-
 We have pretty young members, okay?
 Thank you, Laughman, right at 3.

I can't believe my Oshii Jerko is a Jormie.
 Jerko?
 Dude, it looked like Jerko on my screen.

 Maybe it's better to be ignorant, you know?
 Coffin game and its consequences
 have been disastrous for the denizens of FaZe World.

 My potions are too strong for you, traveler.
 Potion seller, I tell you, I'm going into battle and I want only your strongest potions.
 You can't handle my potions.
 They're too strong for you.
 Potion seller, listen to me.
 I want only your strongest potions.
 My potions would kill you, traveler.
 You cannot handle my potions.
 Potion seller, enough of these games.
 I'm going into battle and I need your strongest potions.
 My strongest potions would kill you, traveler.
 You can't handle my strongest potions.
 You'd better go to a seller that sells weaker potions.
 Potion seller, I'm telling you right now, I'm going into battle and I need only your strongest potions.
 You don't know what you are, traveler.
 My strongest potions will kill a dragon, let alone a man.
 You need a seller that sells weaker potions because my potions are too strong.
 Potion seller, I'm telling you, I need your strongest potions.
 I'm going into battle.
 I'm going into battle and I need your strongest potions.
 I can't handle my strongest potions.

 Potion seller, what do I have to tell you?
 Look out, your potions.
 Why won't you trust me with your strongest potions, potion seller?
 I need them.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

If I'm to be successful in the battle, I can't give you my strongest potions because my strongest potions are only for the strongest beings and you are of the weakest.
 What?
 I took potions, seller.
 I'll go elsewhere.
 I'll go elsewhere for my potions.
 That's what you better do.
 I'll go elsewhere for my potions.
 I'll never come back.
 Good.
 You're not welcome here.
 My potions are only for the strongest and you're clearly not of the strongest.
 You're clearly the weakest.
 You've got to say, potion seller, but I have mine.
 You're a rascal.
 You're a rascal with no respect for knights.
 No respect for anything except your potions.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Why respect knights when my potions can do anythingthat you can?
 How is that?

 It was like, I was like a fish out of water.
 What other funny thing can I say?
 I don't remember anymore.
 Mana equals health with the right build?
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

 You know where it has a really good metro system?
 I think Thailand has a really good metro system.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

I think Thailand has surprisingly good metros.
 Bring some other fuel?
 I'll probably bring my mom.
 Thank you, this is a muffin!
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Ever heard of the 7 Stars Kyushu?
 I think I have.
 Is that the really fancy train?
 It's a really fancy train with like the...
 With like the floor, right?
 With like the...
 With like the moss floor?
 I think I talked about this with Pippa?
 Only Bangkok?
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Yeah, yeah.
 Only Bangkok.
 I mean...
 I mean...
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

I mean...
 I mean...
 That's how it is in most cities, right?
 Like in most countries.
 It's like really good infrastructure in their...
 In their like main city.
 Phuket has no buses or any kind of metro?
 Because it's small.
 If I'm not wrong.
 Phuket is pretty...
 Phuket is literally an island, isn't it?
 Where else is a good metro?
 Hong Kong is great metro.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

I think Perth has really bad metro.
 Um...
 Where else?
 That's...
 It's how it is.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Because Perth is not like...
 Where a lot of...
 Movement...
 Actually is.
 I've not been to Taiwan.
 Um...
 Korea?
 I haven't been to their metro since...
 Oh yeah!
 I did look at the Korean metro.
 I did look at the Korean metro.
 Yeah, I think the Korean metro is really good too.
 I looked at the Korean metro.
 I think it's really awesome.
 Um...
 China has really good metro.
 It's pretty decent metro.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

They find good.
 I don't know.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

I look at the map and I'm like...
 Oh!
 That's pretty cool.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

It goes...
 It goes to a lot of places.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

It's a lot of coverage.
 You know?
 Yeah, but...
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

But my favorites...
 Definitely gotta be Japan.
 It just goes like everywhere.
 Just genuinely goes everywhere.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Tokyo is a bit of a mess.
 No, it's not.
 It's so easy to get around.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

I'm a Budapest.
 I've never been there.
 I've never been there.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

I've only really explored a bit of...
 A bit of Asia and a little bit of Europe.
 I've never been to anywhere else.
 I wanna go to...
 I'm gonna go to the States next.
 I wanna bring...
 I wanna bring my setup with me
<NEW_TOPIC>

so I can stream everywhere.
 I think at my age when I'm not doing anything with my life, I should probably see the world.
 By myself.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Or with my parents, but...
 It's probably more fun by myself.
 Yeah.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Come to America, visit a gun range.
 Can...
 Okay, okay.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

One question, right?
 About gun ranges.
 About gun ranges.
 Can I shoot any gun I want?
 Or...
 Or are there things that I can't shoot?
 Like...
 Whatever gun they have, can I shoot any gun?
 Do you believe you come to the States to get authentic barbecue?
 Yeah, that's my first thing, man.
 I need to get Texas...
 Uh...
 What is that?
 Barbecue.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Bullets are expensive?
 Yeah, yeah,yeah.
 I don't mind.
 I don't mind.
 Depends on the state.
 Like...
 If I wanna shoot a rifle...
 Can they...
 Do they let me?
 Will they let me?
 I wanna shoot like three bullets from a rifle.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Will they let me?
 Will they let me?
 Why are you still awake?
 Not everybody lives in the States, bro.
 Yes?
 Yeah?
 I mean they will, but
<NEW_TOPIC>

the recoil...
 You think I'll get my shoulder dislocated?
 I think that'd be really funny, though.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

I think that'd be really funny.
 Actually, I'm gonna...
 I'm gonna have to get somebody to go with me.
 Because I don't wanna pay for...
 I wanna pay for...
 For a...
 For a...
 Ambulance.
 Over there.
 It's like $1,000.
 Not dislocated?
 For...
 For real?
 I've heard that people still just getting dislocated from shooting guns.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Won't you fly away from the knockback?
 I don't think that's how it works.
 Right?
 More like $5,000.
 Are you kidding me?
 For a freaking ride to the hospital when you're like half dead and they want you to pay $2,000?
 For a freaking ride?
 Nevada has ranges for every gun?
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Even miniguns?
 Are miniguns expensive?
 I'm literally a Looney Tunes character.
 I'm so mean!
 So mean!
 I'm gonna cry.
 Tonight I'm gonna...
 I'm gonna go to bed and then...
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Your words will echo in my head and then I'll have nightmares.

 Man, it's awesome though.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Why are so many VTubers Canadian?
 I'm not Canadian.
 What the hell?
 Big chunkly!
 Chunggelly!
 Bless my beautiful chunkus life.
 Phase goes to a gun range would be a fun stream.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

I would then be able to meet up with some phase girls.
 Yeah.
 I might be able to meet up with some staff as well.
 It would be so cool.
 That would be awesome!
 That would be fun!
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

If I can get a freaking visa.
 If I can go to the freaking states.
 Can't be that bad, right?
 Like it can't be that bad.
 Sounds like a fun time.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Sounds like a fun stream.
 Are you Australian?
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Do I sound Australian?
 If you can go everywhere you've been.
 I think you'll be good.

 Places that.
 Actually no.
 I've only traveled alone a couple times.
 I haven't.
 I haven't really traveled to places that are really far away.
 Just.
 Just alone.
 So it's gonna be kind of terrifying, you know.
 Especially.
 Especially as a woman.
 My size.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

My size.
 You wouldn't get it.
 You wouldn't get it!
 You wouldn't get it!

He's uh.
 Really cool.
 Yeah.
 I don't wanna reveal too much.
 You know.
 It's.
 It's my private life.
 I can't.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

I can't tell you too much about my.
 My.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

My husband.
 Yeah.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Yeah me.

<NEW_TOPIC>

He doesn't use any batteries.
 He's real.

 Anyways.

 We're married.
 Straight up man.
 Married.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

It's 1D.
 No it's not.
 What?
 Okay.
 What is even one.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

One dimensional?
 So it's just voice?
 Just voice?
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

So if you edate.
 On discord.
 And you've never seen him before.
 And you only know.
 And you've only heard his voice.
 Does that mean it's a one dimensional guy?
 Just a single line.
 That's 0D.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Oh it's called the voice in my head.
 It's called my tulpa.
 Where would 1D even be?
 Like.
 It would be like.
 Wait no.
 2D is 2 planes.
 Wait what?
 2D is 2 planes.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Wait what?
 I'm rusted.
 Is your husband single?
 Bro!
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

What kind of question is that?
 Is your girlfriend single?
 2D?
 Those 2 dimensions.
 Like 2 points.
 Right?
 Like.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

So 1D is just a line.
 It wouldn't even.
 It wouldn't even be a line.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

You wouldn't.
 You wouldn't even be able to see it.
 From one end.
 It's just a line.
 It's a dot.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Dude.
 1D doesn't even mean anything.
 That's enough for today.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Time to take your meds.

<NEW_TOPIC>

It's gotta be the saddest thing I've ever said in my entire career.
 God.
 Jesus Christ.
 I need to go outside.
 Thank you.
 We didn't go out of my mind.
 So that's why she was thirsting for Okabe the other day.
 80% coconut.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

No Okabe is married to Kurisu.
 I can't.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

I can't take him away from her.
 I ship them.
 So I'm not like into him.
 I don't see myself with him.
 I think he's cool.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

 So.

 They're canonically.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

They're canonically like.
 Married.
 They've gotta be.
 So.
 Yeah.
 Maybe another time.
 In another world line.
 No.
 I don't wanna.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

They have to be together in every world line.
 I wish.
 I wish for.
 Them to be together in every single world line.
 Even in world lines where they're not together.
 Jellie you have to fight for your man.
 I don't want to be with him.
 I want him to be.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

I want him to be with Kurisu.
 This is not cucking.
 Being.

<NEW_TOPIC>

Hey chat.
 Is being happy.

 For somebody else's relationship.

 I don't need saving.
 I need saving.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

How happy?
 Jelly, just because there's a goalkeeper doesn't mean you shouldn't try to score.
 What?
 Hey, chat!
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

If I say congratulations on your marriage, do I have a cuck fetish?
 What the hell do you guys even mean?
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

What are you even talking about?
 What are you even talking about?
 You're insane!
 You're all insane.
 You're all insane, dude.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Dude, what if I'm just happy for them?
 What is happening?
 I'm-I'm flabbergasted!
 Absolutely out of my mind!
 Bye, chats.
 Completely insane ramblings.
 You guys are so rotten-brained, it's crazy.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Your- your- your brains are all so rotten.
 It's like-it's like-it's like watching anime.
 It's like a-it's like smoking.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

But instead of your lungs becoming black, it's your brain.
 Rotting and melting into a goopy-
 into a goopy, disgusting puddle of flesh and blood.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Dang it, eagle!
 Hint of cuckness.
 What?!
 Jesus.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

We're the most normal of chats in FaZe.
 I wouldn't know.
 I wouldn't know!
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Every hotel room has a jelly hoshi-
 I-what the heck are you guys even talking about?
 You guys are insane.
 You have such a way with the words, jelly.
 Thank you!
 I feel like I've gotten better at English since we first met.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

I think I was way worse-
 putting my-
 uh- uh-
 way worse at putting my thoughts into-
 words.
 Like a year ago.
 Crazy?
 I was crazy once!
 They put me in a room- a brain rot room!
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

We're the best chat- the greatest chat people often say.
 I think-I think you guys can be pretty funny.

 keyword.
 I'm now enlightened.
 I'm also-
 I also have-
 I've also been driving for two hours.
 I'm not into NTR-
 dude, are you guys-
 I-
 Jesus.
 Being happy for somebody's marriage and shipping people does not mean I'm into NTR.
 Go get your brains checked.
 I think NTR sucks.
 Anyways, what-
<NEW_TOPIC>

what other- what other anime relationships do I- do I support?
 Or do I ship?
 I- I genuinely can't think of any other-
 what pairings do you guys ship?
 Do- did you- do-do men-do men also have this like-
 this shipping- this crazy shipping thing that girls have?
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Like, do you guys like, go like, oh my god, I ship these two characters, they're so cute together.
 And stuff.
 Your mom and your dad-
 Oh, thanks.
 That's awesome, actually.
 I ship them too.
 I'm glad to have a functional family.
 What?
 No?
 You think shipping is like a- is like a woman thing?
 I recommend you listening to Break Up in a Small Town from Sam Hunt.
 I don't wanna listen to-
<NEW_TOPIC>

I don't wanna listen to an NTR song.
 Yeah, it's a woman thing.
 Shipping is a woman thing.
 Today-
 Today I learned.
 Today I learned.
 Not nearly as crazy.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Ruby and Aqua are my favorite ship.
 That's pretty funny.
 I don't wanna talk about the anime.
 You know, it's ending in like two-two- two more episodes.
 I'm going to strangle somebody.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Just another female flaw.
 True.
 God, who do I- who do I have in the ship?
 Who do I have in the ship?
 Who do I have in the ship?
 Who do I have in the ship?
 Anyone who said they've never shipped anyone is a male and is a goddamn liar.
 Never trust them.
 They ship women all the time.
 Is that true, chat?
 Chat, is that true?
 Is that true?
 You ship women?
 Is that true?
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

You ship- you ship me and Lumi?
 Is that true?
 No.
 No, it's not true?
 No?
 Okay.
 Women with women?
 Yeah, yeah.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Women with women is fine.
 I-I-I-I-I-
<NEW_TOPIC>

I see it.
 I respect it.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

I respect it.
 I see the vision.
 I see the vision.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

I ship USPS.
 I wish you the best of luck.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

You don't dream about the other girls.
 I-
<NEW_TOPIC>

I- I-I-
 I-
<NEW_TOPIC>

I- I-I-
 What the heck do I even ship, dude?
 What do I even ship?
 What do I even ship?
 I'm like a disgusting U major.
 So I can't say what I ship.
 I don't think I do a lot of shipping.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Never trust chat.
 But it's in my blood.
 I'm just conditioned to do so.
 I'm just conditioned to do so.
 Artemy, thank you.
 Ash x Charizard.
 Whatever makes you happy.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

As long as you're not hurting anybody with your...
 Ship?
 Bathtob X Toaster.
 Goku X Vegetable.

 Anyways, you guys are getting weird.
 I was trying to talk about some wholesome stuff, man.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Like...
 Like...

 Like...
 Like Madoka and Homura.
 You know, I think that's pretty wholesome.
 You know?
 Chair x Rope!
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Where's you?
 Where are you?
 You've got to be in there somewhere.
 It's got to be you, x Chair, x Rope.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

That's wholesome.
 That's pretty wholesome.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Madoka is pretty...
 It's not wholesome, but it's...
 It's so burn.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Shipping?
 Like World of Warships?
 Wow!
 Yeah.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Oh, yeah.

 Um...

Yor and Lloyd.
 Yeah, yeah.
 Those.
 People ship them, right?
 I think that's a cute ship.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Very weird ship.
 Whoa.
 But...
 But...
 But that's the point of the whole show.
 Yeah, like...
 Like...
 Like...
 Kaguya and...
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

And...
 Shirogane?
 Kaguya-sama and Shirogane?
 That's...
 That's pretty cute.
 You know, that's...
 That's a good...
 That's a good ship.
 If it's canon, there's no shipping?
 What?
 No, I can still ship something even if it's canon.
 Isn't shipping supposed to be for characters that aren't actually together?
 No, you can...
 What?
 You can also ship canon characters.
 You support it, right?
 You're like, oh, that's my favorite pairing.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Canon X Canon.
 That's not shipping.
 That's just a show?
 Then how am I supposed to...
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

How do I...
 How do I say that I really like their dynamic?
 Do you do crack ships?
 Q-chips are in Azure lane.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Jelly Stream is dying?
 No, your internet is just dying.
 Wait, what?
 No, I'm still uploading.
 Oh, YouTube's is dying.
 Canon is not a ship.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

No, shipping needs to be a head canon.
 What the hell?
 It's a canon.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

It's just a canon ship.
 I'm reading chat
<NEW_TOPIC>

and I'm thinking that...
 I'm thinking that a good portion of you guys are...
 Are misunders...
 You're misunderstanding things.
 You've got to brush up on your...
 On your intelligence before you come in and spread misinformation.
 Thank you, Intrepid Mercenary, for the two.
 Battleships, cruisers, or submarines?
 What are...
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

What are cruisers again?
 Is that the big one?
 Is that the big one?
 What's the...
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

What's the ship that planes can land on?
 Have you written any fanfics?
 Yes, I have.
 I had a phase.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Back when I was 14.
 Carrier.
 Okay,yeah, I love carriers.
 I like carriers.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Aircraft carriers?
 I love carriers.
 I love carriers.
 I freaking love carriers.
 I think carriers are awesome.
 I freaking love carriers.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Why do all girls see me write fanfiction?
 Listen, to be a VTuber, you have to have gone through a phase in your life that's turned you into an irredeemable woman.
 Whose only solace is to become a VTuber.
 To be a VTuber, you have to be severely broken at one point.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

That's all of us in Phase Connect.
 You gotta...
 You gotta have a specific criteria.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

You gotta fulfill a particular criteria to become a VTuber.
 And that criteria is not that great.
 That's why so many of us are so similar.
 Favorite ship?
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

The ice cream factory ship in World War II?
 That's a thing?
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

That's a thing?
 That's a freaking thing?
 That's insane.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

VTuber die.
 I think...
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

I think...
 Because there's a lot of girls...
 Who are not...
 Actually, no.
 I'm just projecting.
 This is just a projection.
 I was about to project.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Sorry.
 I was gonna project.
 Actually, maybe I should project anyway.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

I should project anyway.
 I feel like...
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

In this industry, there are a lot of similar girls.
 And...
 I assume that they've also gone through...
 Their fair share of garbage...
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Their fair share of garbage...
 That has turned them...
 That has...
 Made them terminally online...
 At one point in their life.
 And you have to be...
 A certain personality type...
 To audition...
 For a VTuber company.
 I'm not saying we're all the same.
 I'm saying that...
 We've all been through some crap.
 I'm projecting.
 I'm projecting.
 This is...
 This is a complete projection.
 But I'm gonna project anyway.
 For Faizu me...
 No...
 I mean...
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

I mean a lot of...
 I don't mean just Faiz.
 Stereotyping?
 It's a stereotype!
 But stereotypes exist for a reason!
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

212x399...
 I'm not doing that!
 The sad case of playing League of Legends...
 For sure.
 Yeah, and...
 It's the same with the viewers.
 Right?
 Because you have to be a certain type of person...
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

To chat in the VTuber stream.
 Right?
 You have to be like a certain personality type...
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

To watch VTubers.
 Right?
 So we're all...
 Similar in a way.
 Right?
 Don't call me out like this.
 It's not a bad thing.
 You're just similar to a lot of...
 A lot of us.
 You know?
 I'm not cooking you, dude.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

I'm projecting.
 It's different.
 Right?
 We all have to be a certain type of person...
 To watch a VTuber.
 And to chat in a VTuber stream.
 And to...
 Form a connection with them.
 Does that make sense?
 Not...
 I'm not saying you're depressed.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

No!
 I'm not saying you're depressed.
 I'm just saying you're a certain type...
 Of person...
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

That...
 Is similar...
 To everybody else.
 Not saying you're the same.
 You're similar.
 So...
 Hence...
 Hence...
 I think you guys should make friends.
 I think you guys should be friends with each other.
 Because...
 You guys are similar.
 In a way.
 And you guys can bond over similar interests.
 So I think you guys should be friends.
 What are you trying to say?
 Nothing in particular.
 I'm just...
 I'm just...
 I'm just...
 I'm just psychoanalyzing and...
 And saying you guys should probably be friends with each other.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Because...
 You guys are similar.
 You guys are similar.
 So...
 So you might as well.
 Right?
 You're shipping us?
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

What the freak?
 You guys are insane.
 Okay.
 You know what?
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Screw you guys.
 Forget it.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Forget it.
 I give up.
 Forget it.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

We all eat the same glue brand.
 We all listen to...
 We all listen to emo rock.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

We all listen to emo rock.
 Thank you.
 This is my favorite Super.
 Thank you, ferocious kids.
 I'm at a five.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Are you saying we have to go through a phase in order to connect with you?
 Are you trying to ship us?
 I'm not trying to ship you guys.
 Emo rock sucks.
 You suck.
 Emo rock does not suck.
 I've been yapping for like half an hour.
 I've been yapping for two hours.
 I've been yapping for two hours.
 Yeah, you take that back, bro.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Emo rock does not suck.
 You're not one of us.
 We have an impersonator.
 Are you trying to hook up...
 Are you trying to hook up chat with chat?
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

No.
 I'm just saying you guys should be friends.
 Okay.
 This is another thing I'm...
 I'm pissed off about.
 This is another thing I get really mad about.
 Thank you, Tony, for the super.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

How square can you make your head?
 This is...
 I can only make my head round.
 Thank you, Iris.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Official time for the super.
 Okay, anyways.
 Here.
 Let me rant.
 All right.
 Let me rant.
 I freaking...
 I'm so freaking sick of people that ship...
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

That ship two characters...
 That heavily like...
 Okay.
 Let me rephrase this because it's kind of sensitive.
 Don't want to piss anybody off.
 I am sick and tired of people who say...
 Oh my god!
 They're so gay!
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

When they're obviously doing something that friends do.
 I said it.
 I said it.
 Yeah, I said it.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Like Jesus.
 I'm gonna get fired?
 How is that?
 How is that?
 How is that getting...
 How am I getting...
 How am I getting fired for that?
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

How am I getting fired for that?
 Friends don't do that, though?
 No, like...
 Like...
 Imagine this.
 It's a scene.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

It's a scene of a girl giving another girl...
 Some cookies.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

To be friends with her.
 And then your average...
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Like...
 Twitter user goes like...
 Oh my god!
 They're so gay!
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

This is why these two characters...
 Are canonically gay.
 Like...
 Shut the heck up.
 Thank you Malcolm for the sofa!
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Nine-nine comments say...
 Once they fired...
 You read fired.
 Yeah.
 It's...
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

I don't know.
 I think that's...
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

I think it's...
 Yeah.
 I mean...
 Why would I say things that are...
 Why would I say...
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Why would I respond to comments...
 That are in support of me?
 Right?
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

A lot of us don't have any friends...
 How we know...
 I guess this applies a lot less...
 To like real situations.
 It's like...
 It's like fictional situations.
 Like anime.
 I mean...
 I'm totally hypocritical for saying this.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Because I used to...
 I used to do the same thing.
 But...
 But yeah.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

At least I don't push canonically gay.
 You know?
 Those people have nothing else to live for.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

And no real life friendships.
 I don't know.
 I just really like...
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

I just really like looking at things...
 That makes me angry.
 I just really like looking at like...
 It's like...
 I'm not actually like...
 It's not actually like...
 My day is like ruined.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

But like...
 I like looking at things...
 And go like...
 Oh my god.
 This is so stupid.
 This makes me really mad.
 And I'll just...
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

I'll just...
 I'll just share it with my friends.
 I'll be like...
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Hey dude.
 Look at this...
 Look at this...
 Look at this dumbass.
 And then I'll just move on with my day.
 It's...
 It's recreational...
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Recreational anger.
 God.
 Yeah.
 Like...
 Like...
 Like...
 Yeah.
 Like a...
 Like a really bad woke game.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

I'll look at it and be like...
 Oh my god.
 This makes me so mad.
 And then it doesn't really affect my life at all.
 I'll just move on with my day.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Casual hating compared to ranked hating.
 That's what I do.
 What if we're just coping?
 Listen.
 What if...
 What if we're just coping?
 What if we're just coping?
 What if we're actually...
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

What if our day is actually ruined?
 But we're like coping and going like...
 No, no, no.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

It doesn't affect me at all.
 I'm just doing this for fun.
 But actually we're like seething.
 What if that's it?
 What if that's it?
 What if...
 Can we have a Jerry Ball and a LARP?
 What's a Jerry?
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Oh, Jerry Ball?
 It's a JORP!
 It's called a JORP!
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

It's called a JORP.
 Get it right.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Copium never tasted so good.
 True.
 True.
 True.
 True.
 Let people enjoy things?
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

What if I enjoy being a hater?
 True.
 True.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

True.
 True.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Why do I just put this on my head?
 Oh, well.
 I'll just put it here.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

It's big enough, right?
 Oh my god.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

It's like a cloud nose.
 I just realized I'm really low.
 I'm really like low res.
 I've been like 360p for the whole stream.
 I've been 360p the whole stream.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Does it spin the other way?
 Good question.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Let me try.
 I don't think so.
 Oh my god.
 I can do this though.
 Oh.
 I can do this though.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

JORPS.
 We're printing JORPS.
 We're printing JORPS.
 They're being printed.
 That's the factory line.
 How many JORPS is this per minute?
 Like...
 70 JORPS per minute.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

We're printing 70 JORPS per minute.
 New loading bar.
 Oh my god.
 You're right.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

I should put this on my loading screen.
 I'm gonna crash the JORPS market.
 We're JORPS.
 We're gonna JORPS.
 I guess we're doing JORPS now.
 Can we make a JOOB?
 Like a cube?
 Can we make a JOOB?
 70 JPM.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

70 JPM.
 I can make it faster.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

I can make it faster.
 I can make it faster.
 I can also make it slower.
 This is as fast as I can make it.
 What the heck?
 Now it's 80 JPM.
 Thank you Hong Kong guy for the super.
 JORB inflation.
 We're printing JORPS.
 A JOOB.
 The stream is at 144p for me.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

No, I'm just at 144p.
 Look, if you look at the chat,
 it's like high quality.
 It's just me that's in 360p
 because I'm zoomed in, you know?
 Make it slower so it looks like it's rolling.
 I don't know if I can do that, man.
 Thank you, Spider Dude, for the super.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

No!
 My JORB collections value will plummet!
 I can make it go backwards.
 A little bit slowly.
 Jelly, please stare into the webcam.
 Thank you, Li-Ha!
 Fire at 52!
 Thank you, Li-Ha!
 I'm gonna eat the super.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

The JORBs have spoken.
 Thank you, Li-Ha!
 And yeah, I really appreciate it.
 Take care!
 Take care!
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Are the drawers speaking?
 I would know.
 I want...
 A jube!
 Give me a cube!
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

A jelly cube!
 A jube!
 I wonder if that's possible.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Because they made this with a...
 With a 3D jiff maker or something.
 I don't know.
 I want a Jorbilion Jorbs, please.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

We're printing a Jorbilion Jorbs.
 A Jocktagon.
 I don't want a Jocktagon!
 I want a jube!
 I'm good with a Jexagon, though.
 A Jiromid?
 A Jiromid's also fine.
 A Jir...
 Actually, no.
 I don't want a Jiromid.
 I want a Jexagon.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

A Jesseract?
 That would be pretty cool, too.
 You can't just say that, Jelly.
 It's all about how you listen.
 It's all about how you take it.
 It's not my fault.
 It's not my fault.
 Jorjaka Hedron.
 Thank you, Ferocious Kids.
 So many soup.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Ah!
 Try flipping the asset horizontally.
 Oh, bruh.
 Can I even do that?
 Can I even do that?
 Properties?
 No.
 I have to do it.
 Transform.
 Rotate.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Bro, now I'm just printing it.
 Now they're just rolling downhill.
 Okay.
 It's not right.
 Hold on.
 Let me pick the right speed.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

This looks pretty right to me.
 Okay.
 Yeah.
 This looks pretty right to me.
 Okay.
 Now they're rolling down.
 Faster.
 Faster.
 Isn't this the right speed?
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Slow roll?
 Where are they going?
 I don't know.
 I couldn't tell you.
 I couldn't tell you.
 Even if you put a gun to my head.
 I couldn't tell you.
 They're moving.
 Fine.
 I'll make them faster.
 But it doesn't...
 It doesn't look right if it's fast.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

See?
 It looks...
 It looks wrong.
 All right.
 Now this one's...
 This one's all right.
 Okay?
 How fast can it go?
 Not very fast.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

We have a really long line.
 Yeah.
 Like that.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

We have this many.
 I guess I can make them faster now.
 There I go.
 They're rolling.
 And rolling.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

And rolling the jar...
 Jarballs.
 The jarballs.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

The jarballs.
 How does that even work?
 Hey.
 Oh, yeah, we gotta do some Halloween content, man.
 Halloween?
 Man.
 I'm not really good at scary games, though.
 I don't know what to do for Halloween.
 I'm just ignoring it, and hopefully it goes away.
 Thank you, sign for the super.
 They see Jorb rolling, and they hid anything for the Jorb.
 I should dress up for Halloween.
 Yeah, I think I'll dress up for Halloween.
 I'll come back with you with a dress up for Halloween.

What do you guys think I should dress up as for Halloween?
 Halloween karaoke?Good idea.

 A woman.
 But I'm a woman every day.
 It's not special.

 A successful CEO.
 Oh, wow.
 That's a pretty good outfit.
 A witch?
 A witch would be nice.
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Yeah, a witch would be cool.
 A monkey!
 A monkey!
 Please don't vote, monkey.
 Then I'll be forced to become a monkey for Halloween,

We learned a bit about
 About

 About British history
 About British history
 And local history

 We never talked about anywhere else

 Thank you
 Ardemy
 For the 228
 She's gonna ace it
 As a cult leader
 I'm not a cult leader
 Watch this
 You're gonna be so surprised
 I'm gonna be so
 Freaking say so
 I'm basically gonna be like
 Like an angel
 Some people are simply
 More worthy than others
 True
 I'd rather spend
 Three days
 On a private island
 With
 Are we talking like
 Cause this is gonna be
 Way better for networking
 What am I gonna freaking do
 With my best friend
 It's not gonna
 It's
 People by my side
 Right
 So
 This would be
 The more intelligent option
 Jelly stop
 You're gonna get me
 In trouble
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

What
 Hello
 You still there
 Which is more true
 Of you
 When I sit down
 To think about
 The ideas of others
 I often find myself
 Improving on them
 In novel
 And unexpected ways
 When I sit down
 To think about
 The ideas of others
 I often find that
 They do not make
 As much sense
 As my own ideas
 It's pretty
 It's pretty
 It's an interesting question
 Cause when I think
 When I sit down
 And think about
 The ideas of others
 It's not the first thing
 That comes to my mind
 Right
 I think about
 I think about
 Why this person's idea
 Does not work
 As well as it should
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

And
 Whether
 Any other idea
 Would be better
 And I
 Okay
 I guess I try
 To
 Improve on them
 A little bit better
 Which is more true
 Of you
 While I am a good listener
 I'm definitely at my best
 When I can be allowed
 To speak up
 And spar
 With others
 While I am a good speaker
 I'm definitely at my best
 When I can be allowed
 To collect myself
 And concentrate
 On what I want to say
 Dealing with people
 Can be unpleasant
 But people themselves
 Can never be awful
 Or horrible
 No way
 Some people are just
 Born
 Born
 Born bad
 Thank you so much
 Super
 No way dude
 People are
 Some people are literally
 Just bad to the core
 Which is more true of you
 I've been known
 To let administrative things
 Like insurance
 And tax returns
 Fall through the cracks
 I'm somewhat compulsive
 About staying on top
 Of administrative things
 Like insurance
 And tax returns
 What does this mean?
 Like I do my taxes
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

And I do
 Administrative things
 Like insurance
 This is
 This means I forget
 To do them
 And this means
 This means I
 This means I forget
 And this means
 I don't forget
 Jelly
 Do you think
 Some people are better
 Than others?
 Yeah
 Straight up
 They're just born different
 You pay your bills ontime
 Yeah
 The first
 All the time
 I would rather
 Be familiar
 And conversant
 With all manner
 Of different ideas
 Or pursue
 A select few ideas
 Or interests
 Until I feel like
 I feel that
 I have mastered them
 All the way
 From top to bottom
 Hmm
 Hmm
 I guess this
 I'm good at
 I like to be
 Versatile
 I like to be
 Versatile
 Hi
 How's it going?
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

I'm good man
 I'm just doing
 The murderous villain test
 Because somebody
 In chat
 Told me to
 I like to be
 I like to be
 Within a group
 Within a group
 How do I do this?
 I'm not very often
 In groups
 How do I say neither?
 I'm not really sure
 I guess one on one
 Nobut I'm talking to you
 Right?
 So that's
 That's
 That's a group
 Okay
 How about this?
 Do I like to hang out
 With multiple people
 Or do I
 Do I like to hang out
 With people
 One on one?
 I'm really awkward
 One on one
 I'm genuinely so awkward
 One on one
 If a sign says no smoking
 If a sign says no smoking
 I don't think I would
 What?
 But I don't think I would
 It's
 Cause I'm gonna get fined
 If I get smoke
 If I smoke
 It's so stupid
 To
 Do something
 As simple as
 To
 It's so
 It's so silly
 To
 Break the rules
 For fun
 Tempted
 Part of me
 Would be tempted
 Would I be tempted?
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

But I don't even smoke
 I literally do not even smoke
 You can be honest
 I am honest
 I am honest
 I wouldn't smoke
 Thank you David
 But it's so bad
 The cute BGM
 Always makes these moments
 Funnier
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

But I
 I wouldn't
 I wouldn't even
 Okay
 So
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

So if I
 If there's
 If there's a part of me
 That would click on this
 That
 Even considered
 Clicking on this top button
 Then it's over for me
 Right?
 I more often
 Think to myself
 That
 People over
 Complicate things
 The world
 Isn't that complex
 People over
 Simplify things
 Have a little more
 Newance
 My mood
 Changes frequently
 And rapidly
 I would rather
 Discover a new
 Scientific concept
 Why would I even
 Learn a freaking
 Dead language?
 Are you insane?
 Are you dumb?
 Let a friend
 Are you
 A lot
 The world
 Will be a better place
 If people
 More people
 Are more logical
 You tend to be
 What people expect
 You to be
 Because you want
 To be liked
 This is a pick me
 Wait am I reading
 The clarinet
 You tend to be
 What people expect
 You to be
 Because you
 Yeah sure
 Of course
 In social situations
 I'm probably
 Closer to being
 You sometimes
 Keep old plane
 And movie tickets
 As memorabilia
 Sometimes
 No
 What the heck
 That's hoarding
 I feel better
 About
 Knowing I have
 The freedom
 To change course
 Or careers
 When it suits me
 Knowing I've
 Planned
 Which statement
 Do you agree
 With more?
 Oh my god
 I'm generally
 Pretty sensitive
 To all the various
 Music, noise
 And advertising
 Images
 They're invariably
 Thrown in my face
 Over the course
 Of a normal day
 I wish public life
 Life was less tangled
 Up in all those stimuli
 I don't really like
 All the music, noise
 And advertising
 Images
 That I throw
 To my face
 Over the course
 Of a normal day
 But then again
 Who does
 It's not something
 That's worth
 Getting upset over
 I like advertising
 I'm struggling
 I'm struggling
 To understand
 This question
 I'm struggling
 To understand
 This question
 I wish public life
 Was less
 Less tangled up
 In all those stimuli
 Do I
 Wish public life
 Was less tangled up?
 I guess I do
 I do
 I do
 I would rather
 It not
 I would rather
 Do things
 And sit around
 Analyzing them
 Most of my
 Analysis
 Is done in the
 Shower
 Most of my
 Thinking
 Is done in
 Bed
 Or in the
 Shower
 I would say
 I have a
 Pretty
 I would say
 I have a
 Pretty level
 Distribution
 Of when
 I do things
 And when
 I analyze
 Things
 I like
 Some advertising
 When it's like
 Targeted
 Because what
 Is the point
 In not liking
 Advertising
 Right
 Like you're not
 You're not gonna
 Be able to
 Stop it
 Advertising
 Is just gonna
 Get in your
 Face
 Way worse
 So what's
 What is the
 Point in
 Getting upset
 About it
 It's going
 To
 It's only
 Going to
 Keep
 Getting worse
 I mean
 I have
 Adblock
 Look
 I literally
 Have adblock
 In my
 Browser
 But
 Like
 I don't
 Like it
 When it's
 Like
 In
 When it
 Like
 Interrupts
 My content
 I guess
 I block
 Ads
 Whenever I
 Can
 And I
 Will
 Fed
 Post
 Against
 Advertisers
 But look
 As a
 Company
 Right
 As a
 Company
 You have
 To look
 You have
 To look
 At this
 From like
 A seller's
 Perspective
 It's because
 You're a
 Consumer
 If you
 Look at it
 From a
 Seller's
 Perspective
 You would
 Also
 Advertise
 To make
 Your business
 Be more
 Known
 Right
 So they
 Are paying
 Money
 They're paying
 Money
 To advertise
 Their business
 To you
 Because they
 Think that
 You will
 Like it
 We
 As FaZe
 Also
 Does
 Ads
 Right
 So
 And because
 Of some
 Ads
 Because of
 Some
 Some of
 The ads
 You've
 Discovered
 FaZe
 Not on
 Seller's
 Side
 So I
 Don't
 Care
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

But you
 Have
 To look
 At it
 From
 As
 Many
 Angles
 As
 Possible
 You
 Can't
 Just
 Be
 Close
 Minded
 And
 Only
 Look
 At
 It
 From
 Your
 Consumer
 Angle
 Because
 Everybody
 Is
 Different
 And
 Everybody
 Has
 A
 Different
 Like a
 Different
 Need
 A
 Different
 Goal
 If I
 Was
 An
 Advertiser
 I
 Would
 Simply
 Make
 Interesting
 Ads
 That's
 What I'm
 Talking
 About
 Interesting
 Ads
 Like
 Their
 Ads
 Ads
 Are
 Good
 Their
 Ads
 Are
 Bad
 But
 To
 Reject
 All
 Ads
 Is
 A
 Little
 Close
 Minded
 In
 My
 Opinion
 I
 Do
 Have
 Ad
 Blocker
 Because
 I
 Don't
 Like
 It
 When
 Ads
 Are
 Invasive
 But
 When
 They're
 Not
 Invasive
 I
 Think
 They're
 Fine

 recognition and credit for the work I contribute which is more often true of you someone asked me a
 question doesn't give me enough time to think of an answer before they resume talking I ask someone a
 question and get impatient when they don't match my conversational pace

 the other parties involved.

 Sometimes I feel less successful
 Compared to others
 On social media
 I have a strong moral compass
 Hell nah
 I don't need to be committed
 To a person
 Hell nah
 Everything that exists
 Can in the final instance
 Be boiled down to the laws of physics
 I'm open
 To certain things being different
 Or certain things being
 Certain things changing
 I don't
 Exactly
 I don't know
 If we've discovered
 Everything yet
 But in this state
 That we are in
 Then yes
 I think so
 Sometimes I consume food
 Or beverages
 To the point of
 I'm someone who craves
 The thrill of immediate action
 I do
 Extramarital affairs
 Are alright
 Even when one's partner
 Doesn't know about them
 What the hell
 People spend too much time
 On introspection nowadays
 Like
 Like self reflection
 I think people should reflect
 On themselves more actually
 Before they
 I think people should reflect
 On themselves more often
 Before they post on twitter
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

So I think people
 Don't spend enough time
 I spread rumors
 I spread rumors

 Over my long term goals

 A good balance
 I lie
 Or mislead others

<NEW_TOPIC>

It's challenging for me to do
 Is to stop doing something enjoyable
 Even when I know it's time to stop
 Like making music past 2am
 Oh yeah
 I'm honest and upfront with others
 Even when it's difficult
 Yeah
 Upfront
 Most of the time
 Unless like you know
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Unless like maybe fringe cases
 Like
 They're really sensitive about
 Their music
 They're 14 years old
 And this is their first FL Studio song
 And they show it to me
 And it sucks
 Complete garbage
 But they're so sincere about it
 Obviously
 I should tell them
 That it's good
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

And they should keep going
 If I oppose the election of a politician
 I would be glad to see them fail
 Huh?
 I'm not sure
 Can't tell you
 Yeah
<NEW_TOPIC>

but you gotta call garbage garbage
 Listen
 I am only here where I am today
 Because people listened to my garbage
 Back in the day when I first made music
 And they said it was good
 And I should keep going
 That is what made me continue making music
 Right?
 If people have caught
 If
 I
 Was dancing when I was a kid
 And the teacher
 Called
 Teacher said I sucked
 And I never danced again
 Sometimes there are things
 That you should
 Not
 Be brutally honest about
 Especially when somebody is just starting out learning something
 I struggle to control my anger
 True
 I struggle to control my cravings
 Not really
 I'm not sure
 If I'm split between two products I want
 The ideal outcome would be me owning them both
 Depends on the type of product
 If it's like a hair product
 Then I'll use one
 And then I'll use the other one
 If it's like headphones
 Then I'll only pick one
 What do you crave Jerry?
 I wanna eat but I'm on a diet
 You know that kind of cravings?
 I feel like I'm
 I feel like I fall
 Actually
 I would
 I'm pretty good at controlling cravings
 Like some of them
 Most of them actually
 I don't eat any snacks
 Even though I want to
 You sound like the blue haired anime girl from Phase Connect
 Hi
 My name is Joldy
 But if you had enough money for both
 Then I would get both
 calming techniques who does that
 engaging with life with enthusiasm feels pointless due to the potential for future sorrow
 it's always important to it's important to enjoy things in the moment you know
 I have changed I am now reformed I think it's importantI think it's important to
 to be happy while you can what the hell
 acting negatively toward others out of spite or resentment I don't actually hate anybody do I
 only dislike people but when I dislike them I just simply do not engage I just do not engage
 do you hate us
<NEW_TOPIC>

I do you hate fictional characters does that count it's different because fictional
 characters don't have feelings but real people do who did you say will never have a girlfriend
 I don't really like ah sorry I don't really like acting negatively because that shows weakness you
 know it's like you're weak to them and when you're weak to them and when you hate them and when you
 actively post hate comments and when you anti them you lose because they live in your head rent free
 I appreciate the qualities and successes of others seeing them as an inspiration for my own growth
 I I do I do my friends when they are successful I'm happy for them what the hell
 making a lot of money is one of my most important goals I do like money I can enjoy hurting others
 I gotta think about this
 Julie why did you punch us in the ear I'm sorryI my my um my cable for my mic is a bit old
 so when I like move it it sometimes does that if it's consensualoh yeah
<NEW_TOPIC>

if it's consensual then it's fine
 it's okay to lie since you never know who you can so true human beings are nothing more than
 complicated biological machines what kind of freaking question is this
 oh yeahokayI did the good I picked itcorrectly I thought I picked it on the on the far end of the agree
 cycle the hell is this
 we're all just flesh Gundams for our brains
 the hell I don't really think about this I don't think it matters
 at times I find it hard to be genuinely happy for others when they achieve something I desire
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

yeah everybody does is jealousy it's natural
 I focus on my personal progress and milestones understanding that comparing myself to others is
 mostly a fool's errand
 if you don't compare yourself to others you do not know what the measures for success is
 the best way to measure success is when you are in a race with somebody else
 so does this mean and disagree
 why base your own success on others
 what do you mean because that is the measure
 the measure of everybody else around you doing the same thing as you
 is a measure for success
 that's destructive thinking
 how do you know success if you don't know what's the benchmark
 something like that I guess like
 like I used to compare with my compare myself with peers that started at the same time as me
 andum yeahI don't know I think I think it's goodit's healthy competition
 you know benchmark is your past self
 no no
<NEW_TOPIC>

no if you grow at your own pace
 you will never push yourself you will never be able to push yourself if you do not compare yourself
 if you are in if you are
 okay let's take let's let's think about sports right if you're a runner how do you know you are fast
 just because you are faster than you were yesterday does not mean you are fast
 does that make sense
 you compare yourself with people who are also running
 but don't let it get too hard too much into your head because you can you grow at your own speed
 you'll never be fast enoughyeahthat's itthat's life you'll never be good enoughand that's how we live
 and life is about understanding accepting that you will never be the best in what you dobut it's
 okay to continue to try to achieve it because maybe one day you can become the best at what you do
 humans without ambition without a goal are dead
 you can be the best at what you do
 something like that
 i mean ii mean personally i like to compare myself because i like to be competitive i've always been
 sort of competitivebut i don't like that get too much into my head because it's unhealthy if
 it's all you obsess aboutbut i like being competitive because it's it's fun and exciting when i can reach my goals
 you know life is a highway what the heck does that even mean
 like life is a highway life life is a life is a highway
<NEW_TOPIC>

yeah life is a highway
 highway
 highway the hell
 yeah does that does that does that make does that does that make uh does that make sense
 my ego is not frill enough that i cannot recognize when someone is better than me or something
 okay that makes a lot of sense actuallyyeahsometimes it's better to just accept that people
 are better than you
<NEW_TOPIC>

but it's not wrong to compare yourself to them because it promotes growth i guess
 it's hard to be
 what the hell is that super chat
 what the hell is that super chat
 bro bro bro you're gonna get yourself banned come on it's funny but don't say thatagain
 oh oh racers you mean racersokay that's okaythat's a typo on your end okay
 that's fine that's fine but don't say that word it's it's not uh
 we're not racistokay
 okayokay all right just between you and me life is like a box of chocolate
 i'm normal
 i'm normal actuallyno i'm not thank you
 my dad's for the kiss of bar
 i'm not
 it's a waste of time to consider other people's viewpoints as i'm almost always right
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

actually it's the opposite because i'm a woman
 thank you car and core
 i'm not really not reallyi think it's i think iti think you have to plan a little bit
 breaking promises or betraying confidence feels justified to me if it gets me what i want
 i'm not really not really i'm not reallyi'm not reallyi'm not really
<NEW_TOPIC>

i'm not really
 they're fringe cases they're fringe cases like if somebody said
 hey can you tell me this trade secret i'll give you a billion dollars i will do it in like a heartbeat
 even though i promised sakuna that i would not leak his trade secret but if somebody offered me a
 million dollars you bet i am leaking that
 i can pay for the legal fees with a billion dollars what if you have an nda i can pay for the legal fees
 if the guy is like tell me i'll pay for your legal fees i'll be likeyeahyeahsure
 this will be brought up in court
 yeahyeah
<NEW_TOPIC>

it's not like i didn't do it
 can you even be sent to jail for breaking an nda
 i guess it depends on likeokay okayokay how about this
<NEW_TOPIC>

okay there's no nda he just said don't
 tell anybodyand i said okay i promise
<NEW_TOPIC>

and then somebody's like hey can you tell me i'll give you
 like 500 000 i would tell them
 oh it's just money just just damagesokayyeah
 but that's a fringe case right
 i'll be sued to poverty dudeyeah it's all about whether the money they're offering me is greater than
 what i would be losing
 right this is not face
<NEW_TOPIC>

can i can't sue me for a million dollars
 the biggest problem with breaking nda is isn't the cost but it's reputational damage
 i take the money and then never come back
 but nobody would trust you who cares i'm never coming back
 thank you blank for the 10 life did not give us lemons we crossbreed them ourselves you got to
 make your own success life isn't gonna hand it to you deep and true
 she actually is saddam hussein
 typical woman bought with moneyokay
 okay look
 true
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

i'm like rubbing my chin as if i have anything on my chin
 i'm rubbing my chin as if you can see it
 i mean i mean
<NEW_TOPIC>

i mean it would be it would be stupid to not take the money
 it will be stupid it'll be stupid to not take the money
 i would say in the middle because it's a pretty high bar
 yeahyeahit's exactly that email true true
 i mean i mean if you're giving me more money than i'll ever make in my life
 i would be stupid to not take it
 yeah hypothetical question everybody has their price and my price is
 as long as it's higher than what's keeping me here
 thank you the zombie outbreak went in six months jerry goatee confirmed with fishman send assassins or just sue

 but your giftbut that's just a chancebut that's just a chance
 okay i reflect on my responses to conflicts to learn how i can handle similar situations more
 commonly in the future i struggle to follow through my commitments because of my impatience
 no way you commit you commiti'm often prone to making rash decisions sometimes i tend to act on impulse sometimes
 what the hell
 yeahi often feel like a victim of circumstance unable to control my own happiness
 i used to be like this
 used to be like this um
 um
 once again
 average i can't say it
 but
 well
 average woman
 but well
 i've learned that
 fate is in your hands
 you can jump for the beef
 you can rank up to be a pro
 when someone achieves something great i feel motivated and inspired rather than diminished by what they have accomplished
 i don't really feel anything
 i don't really care
 i'll be upset if my success came at someone else's expense
 not really but depends
 get it twisted
 per the real
 making for the five months
 paint rent to my favorite bobobo character
 jiggler's jelly jiggler
 awesome morning
 morning
 thank you welcome welcome back five months
 feels easier to stay in a seosaur on the risk getting hurt by pursuing new joys
 the hell is this emo stuff
 okayso is this basically if i dumb down this question is basically
 it's easier to keep your expectations low
 than to expect
 something great
 don't get it twisted
 does that make sense
 because yeah
 
<NEW_TOPIC>

it is true
 see it's it's better
 it's a lot better
 to be accepting
 that your life is just the way it is
 than to think that tomorrow might be better
 you know what that means
 you know what i mean by that
 my frustration sometimes leads leads me to wish ill on others
 my thoughts after dual and negative emotions like sadness grief or regret
 i'm actually thinking about work
 do i think about this i never think about this
 do i think about this
 i guess i sometimes doom
 i guess i dobut it's not often
 i have something done what was convenient for me
 hellyeah

 greed
 longing for more than one needs particularly material wealth
 it signifies a deep insecurity and misunderstanding of true value
 leading away from spiritual composure and inner contentment
 i would say that i want money because i like things that require money

 concerned about them dying i'm not gonna kill my parents
 okay interestingso i don't have to be worried about that

 hmm
 happiness for them like it's not something i can stop you know like i do feel happy for thembut i
 also wish that hey i wish that were me
