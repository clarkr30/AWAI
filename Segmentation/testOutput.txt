<NEW_TOPIC>
For the super chat By the way With my new GPU I can finally generate My own My own AI art And that's gonna be real cool No man Not all furries Are the same Not all furries Are same And icky Some furries Are fine Alright I'm gonna build this thing Allocating too much Can cause FPS spikes Just give your system Around 25% of leeway 16 gigs of RAM You can allocate 10 to 12 gigs I have 64 gigs of RAM 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Does that mean I should allocate 48 gigs? Is that how that works? Phantom Thank you for this Super chat 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I'm not a furry Stop calling me a furry Is it four 3x3 base Or what? I need to google this Uh Uh Nah Nah Nah Nah Nah eh Ehcean 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Eh Eh Him Eh I Eh Eh Eh Eh eh Eh 5x4 4x4 4x4 Blockface 4x4 4x4 4x4 4x4 Blockface Well, the height of 3 blocks So like this? Is this enough? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Just go for slightly over a recommended amount, 12 gigs If you allocate too much, the garbage collection will kill your framerate occasionally I mean, I do have I used to play on like 8 gigs Now I'm on like 12 Not sure if it's any better I ran out of blocks God If you want him to stop, why don't you like everyone? Alright, I'll stop liking him from now on I just think he's a great I think just I just think that the generations are real good, you know? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
So if I like encourage him to stop generating furry me Maybe he'll generate some regular images of me that I can enjoy That's why, that's my logic Okay, they are really good, right? That's why it messes me up, man Dude, it's so messed up It's actually so messed up Oh my god, it's Jelly Hi, that's me Hi Okay, let's do this This height And I'll So valve where? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
On the walls Controller here? Ow 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Alright, so this works Do I have to power this? Jelly, you've met real people, right? Yes, I've met real people These work a lot better in the desert Ah, because of the evaporation I am in the desert I'm in the cold desert Look top right I'm in the cold desert 
<NEW_TOPIC>
So good Oh yeah, yeah I might be a fool Let's just make them all like this height 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Probably Probably Alright That's a good amount Um Uh, I'm gonna switch this This valve to be over here Ah, snap I'm gonna switch this valve to be here 
<NEW_TOPIC>
And the valve to be here Let's do another valve here I'm not sure what these valves are for One output and one input, I presume Temp 283 286.22k Is that good? Okay 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Um Fluid or heat in or out? Do I need to power this machine? Or something? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Or um Because they're telling me to put some advanced solar generators I just want to make the mecha suit This is just to make lithium This is just for lithium, nothing else Um Okay Okay So This Heat 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Um Okay so brine Brine is made from Water Okay so literally just water Water Okay So literally just water Okay It literally can't be that hard Um So I'm gonna pipe in water Into here What the heck? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Fluids Fluids Okay Okay Okay 
<NEW_TOPIC>
So water in here Um Is it gonna Is it not hot enough? This is not hot enough Alright so I should just go make the solar generators right? Okay 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Inductive heaters? I think I need to make these I think I have to make these Okay I can do this 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Uh so it's three per Jesus Christ Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh Might have glass Ahhhhhhhhhh Resistive heaters What are resistive heaters? Do I only need one? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Do I only need one? Do I only need one? One? With all you learned about nuclear power, can you make one that goes boom RL having the materials blink twice to say yes? No, I don't know how to make an actual nuclear reactor, that's crazy So that needs power You don't need power Onefall How to get a friend from a flirt Good night. Good night. I thought you were a scientist and you can't make a nuclear reactor dropped. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I'm only a scientist in Minecraft. It's different. It's different. Holy frames, I allocate too much RAM. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Okay, so you're saying that I only need to do this. Right, I need to power this. Right? So I'm gonna pick one of these windmills. It's not part of multiblock. I put it on a valve? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
So I need to make two more valves? Okay. It's so hot in my room. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Why is it so hot? Okay. Alright. Okay, I can put the heat in through a valve. Do I need a heat pipe for this? Or can I just put it on a valve? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I need a thermal pipe. Oh my f... 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I should just dig a hole in the roof so I can go any easier. Uh... Valve? Valve. Valve. Valve. Valve. Valve. Valve. Valve. Valve. Valve. Valve. Valve. Valve. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Valve. Valve. Valve. What the heck did it just take damage to? Heat. What are the pipes for heat? What are the pipes for heat?

Turn around to our pulses scatter- manual pain stove-空ight foam set of oothinking- blast into the pan- Is this going far too far? I don't know what you like it's gonna- Thank you For the tip Okay 
<NEW_TOPIC>
So So I Break this And evolve Here And evolve here Too Right And then I get These resist Resistive heaters I'm glad you're back I'm glad to be back too And then I'm gonna heat these With wind generators Doesn't matter if it sucks I'm gonna assume it doesn't need much heat Do I have to stick the power in here? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Rotate Rotate Rotate What the heck What? What? Okay now it's hot Oh Oh the brine The brine's coming in Oh sweet Awesome Oh awesome I see the brine Look It's being brined Spring brine Sweet Sweet Brine Sweet Sweet Sweet Sweet Sweet Sweet Sweet Sweet Sweet Baby Sweet Sweet Sweet Sweet Sweet Sweet Sweet Sweet Sweet 
<NEW_TOPIC>
And now I just move the brine over. I guess. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Or something like that. Oh god. Okay. And now it should turn into liquid lithium. Yay. So we have liquid lithium now. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Which should get put into a chemical crystallizer. Right? Let me see. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
So liquid lithium. We need a condensin traitor. A condensin traitor into a thing. Condensin traitor. A rotary condensin traitor. And I'm gonna need a chemical crystallizer. So we need some elite control circuits. We need some regular circuits. We need some basic control circuits. Which is made from enriching redstone. Enriching osmium with redstone. Osmium. Enriching. Enriching. Osmium is redstone. Okay. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Isn't that a radioactive material? Wait. What is? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Lithium? No? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
No way. Nah. This is good enough. We need some refined obsidian. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Which is refined obsidian dust. I think we need three. Or four? Oh. We need way more refined obsidian dust. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
So we have refined enriched obsidian right here. Which we will. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Put it with a reinforced alloy. How many do we need? So two for once. We need a total of four. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Four of those. Like this? So a tip. Your brine producing tower should be around 10 times the height of your lithium producing tower for peak efficiency. I could not care less about the brine right now. I don't think I need that much brine, right? It's for batteries. What's an earlbear flask? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
What's a flask? Let's refine some obsidian. In the. Osmium compressor. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Jelly. Yes? Okay. How would that be fun? Earl and mayor flasks are a real thing. Not in Minecraft. And why would it tell me to get an earl and mayor flask when I'm playing Minecraft? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Why would I need an earl and mayor flask? It's just. It's just a conical flask. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
A chemistry. Wait. I just. I've always called this conical flasks. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Do people not call them conical flasks anymore? Conical. No. Conical. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
They're making a chemistry joke. I guess I'm just an idiot. I guess. I guess. I guess. I'm just dumb or something. Oh shit. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Run. Uh. Okay. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
It makes me get less. So uh. Oops. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Let me get some elite control circuits. Two. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Wait what? Wait what what's going on? There's too many. This is just gear crafting Steel casing And turn down Of a chemical crystallizer Yippee Uh Glad to see you're not recreating the fall universe with more reactor incidents Thanks I'm doing my best I would say this is actually going pretty well All things considered The door not working considered Uh it's night time I'm gonna go to bed Uh Erlenmeyer flask is the American term Conoco flask is the British Commonwealth term I'm not I'm not a chemistry I'm not that big of a chemistry nerd

<NEW_TOPIC>
Oh I think I made too much diamond Oh whatever Okay 
<NEW_TOPIC>
so This thing Atomic alloy Enriched obsidian into reinforced alloy Would be Diamond dust infused alloy Would be Dhammed dust infused alloy Okay Put one more Should be enough Okay yeah That's pretty good 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Uh Now um Now With this I need atomic alloy Which is Enriched Enriched obsidian Into atomic Into Into the Reinforced alloy Okay so How many do I need? Per Two So Two for six to eight I need eight There you go Perfect Perfect 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Now I put Up Up Two for six to eight Four Okay And now I can make This 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Uh now I can make this Four basic energy cubes One two Three four Okay And then And then And then And then I think I'll make new netherite armor Does it carry over if I take off this 
<NEW_TOPIC>
And No I'm trying to make a headgear It doesn't carry over Okay so it's a waste if I do that Um I'm gonna make completely new netherite gear So that involves making Diamond gear So that involves making Diamond gear 
<NEW_TOPIC>
So that involves making Diamond gear Yes Okay I messed it up Okay 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Um About Um zu pon and into Oh my I'm going to make diamond gear Desert I'm gonna make a netherite here with netherite. Oh, how do I make netherite ingot again? Netherite scrap was for diamond?

<NEW_TOPIC>
Uh, my head looks like it's like smaller With the head on Can I like Can I like have a module where I like Where I can have my regular head? You know for the aesthetics And And Antimatter? Maybe I should make some energy units Should I make some energy units? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Feels like a good idea Okay Energy units Basic induction cell Basic energy cube One Two Three Four Basic induction cell Need more energy tablets I ran out of I ran out of alloys The modules of the purple names in Antimatter? Ah! 
<NEW_TOPIC>
they için They still have about They can get mat�도 one of of arms In a to sen J Sen J S when Maybe getbilir By the way, what's nuke resistant? I need an item. I need a block that's nuke resistant.

I can be more passionate. You know? I'll give you your passion. After I make this jetpack suit. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
After I make this jetpack unit. One second. Just give me a moment. Give me a moment. Infused alloy. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Infused alloy. Wait. Do I already have enough? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Yeah. Here we go. I already have enough. I just need a jetpack. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I ran out of redstone. Okay. Okay. So let me make this real quick. Just one moment. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
All right. Just one moment. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Get back unit. How do I install this? How do I install this? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
How the heck do I install this? Anyways. Um Your mom your dad your sister your brother your grandma your grandfather So you see one we wanted a table right a mecha table 
<NEW_TOPIC>
oh My god, there's a mecha tool Wow Oh Oh 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Wow Wow Wow 
<NEW_TOPIC>
What's in Tom and this is Shambler? Oh, what's this? Oh Table What is a mecha table? Modification Oh Modification station This one Shouldn't be that difficult I need two of these Control circuits Need more atomic alloys Are you serious? Are you serious right now? How many freaking atomic alloys do I need huh? Okay whatever I'm gonna make the tool first I need to charge it? I need to charge it I need to charge it I need to charge it I need to charge it I need to charge it A very good pickaxe How good is it gonna be? How good can it be huh? I'm gonna go over to iry land and test it out I should probably get the mecha table working though Because I can't fly 
<NEW_TOPIC>
And that makes me very anxious What the heck? What the heck? Okay 
<NEW_TOPIC>
so atomic alloys is Enriched obsidian Enriched obsidian I'm gonna put this I'm gonna put this Over I'm just gonna put this in here Wait can I not put that in here? Wait what? Why can't I put this in? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
It's soul bound? What? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Huh? Wait what? Oh I'm just lagging Okay nevermind I'm just lagging I'm just lagging Make sure to set it at the max setting I'll try I'll try So atomic alloy would be a diamond Reinforced alloy How many do I need? Four? Reinforced alloy with obsidian Obsidian Enriched obsidian It's 40 MB per right? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
So I need to put two refined obsidian And now Like this Ba ba ba ba Down To people Easy moderator If you're not like that What? What? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Why is it not working? Oh. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I'm so stupid. I'm so stupid. I don't want to talk about it. How do I like power these? How do I like charge all of them? Surely there's like a station where I can stand in it and it charges all of my pieces. Right? A charge pad. Oh my God. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Charge pad. Oh my God. Polished blackstone. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I don't have polished blackstone. Surely yes I do. I lied. Oh. Skye! Thank you for your braid. Welcome braiders. How are the minds of the craft? I'm nearing end game Minecraft. Welcome everybody. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Welcome, welcome. I'm playing Minecraft. This is Minecraft. Can you recognize it? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
This is Minecraft. Okay, look. I made a charge pad. Where do I put this? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Where do I put this charge pad? I put it here? It's not charging anything. Why isn't it charging anything? Why is it? Why am I not charging anything? I'm not charging at all. It's slow. What's the point? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
If I can just take it off and charge it on the cube. Oh my God. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Six million. I have to go to my fishing reactor. Man, that sucks. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Charge pad sucks. All right! Cube time. There we go! 
<NEW_TOPIC>
That's so fast, look at that. No wait time at all. Yeah, look at how fast that this is! Infinity charger! Everything else freaking sucks It could have been charged It could have been charging other items in my inventory Like what? Like what? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I don't have anything that's charging You mean my building gadget? Oh, maybe my configurator? Perhaps Okay, well I am now strong Ish Why is this jetpack Why is this jetpack thing not working? I still need to charge it with hydrogen? What kind of garbage is this? Well, that sucks Does it have a limit? Of how much hydrogen it can store? Is it 16,000? There's an upgrade that absorbs the hydrogen Really? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Really? Really? Really? Liquid hydrogen Liquid hydrogen Liquid hydrogen Liquid hydrogen Sprinting speed Defy gravity Evenly distributes charge Throughout all worn Mecha suit armor Dosimeter Automatically feeds the player Nutritional paste 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Oh, solar recharging unit Oh, really? Does this work? Oh, 
<NEW_TOPIC>
wow It doesn't work How does it not? Oh, it does Awesome Oh, electrolytic Oh, this is the one I want Electrolytic Breathing unit Electrolytic breathing unit What about this? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Inhalation purification unit Applies a miniature Electrolytic feel around the breathing Apareous removing Select a portion of Select a portion of egg types Vain mining unit Shearing unit Farming unit Attack amplification unit Excavation escalation unit Radiation shielding unit I'm gonna get this For good measure I'm gonna get some energy units The nuke penetrates all blocks Even bedrock Really? Are you serious? It breaks bedrock? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
That means we can We can make a hole Into the void? It's kind of crazy Oh, it doesn't break it What doesn't it break then? I just need to know What it doesn't break Tetra ruin blocks Are immune 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Okay, what ignore What's ignored by the nuke? That's all I need to know I ran out of this I ran out of freaking tin ingots No! I ran out of tin ingots 
<NEW_TOPIC>
No, I don't even care I'm just gonna smelt it I can't be bothered 36,000 hydrogen Okay Okay A bunch of energy units in here I will now Get this Put it in here Give it in here Give it the Electrolytic breathing unit What? Does it not work? Oh, helmet 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Okay then Energy unit first Doubles it Wait, do I need the radiation shielding unit For every piece? Okay Reed? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Hi, my name's Jelly I'm I don't know how to read I never freaking learned how to read Okay Let's get the Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Anon! Good night! I guess Anon! Are you the, anon? No, actually don't answer Don't answer me I was gonna ask you a question 
<NEW_TOPIC>
But I don't want to, I don't want you to answer Like, like, you know what I want to do our old schedule sound. I feel really bad. I know. I feel really, really bad. I want to make it work too. But like, I'm having so much trouble like balancing like, like, you know, what I want to do and what's right to do. I don't know what's right. And I feel really bad for moving my old schedule. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
So I'm still like thinking, you know, and it's, it's, I can't make it work for any, for everybody, you know, and I feel really bad. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Oh, man. Um. Oh. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
If I do it any later, then it's gonna be like in the middle of the night for everybody. And it's gonna suck. Do whatever suits me, but you're more important. I think I'll do midday like this. It's more like an actual work schedule. I'll wake up in the morning. Well, afternoon. I'll eat. And then I'll stream. And then I'll go do some more work in the evenings. I think it's comfortable. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I can get used to this. To the new routine. Thank you for understanding, by the way. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
If you stream 12 hours a day, everyone will be awake at some point. Man. No, I'm more important. No, you are more important. You. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
My star knights as a collective is more important than me. Because you would exist even if I didn't exist. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
But I wouldn't exist if you didn't exist. You know? Get it? Am I right? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I'm right. No, dude. I'm a woman, so I'm right. Just stream 12 hours. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I can't. I can't. Okay. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
No, I'm a firm believer of chatter over streamer and you will not convince me otherwise. You fools. You will not convince me otherwise. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I'm right. I'm literally right. What the heck? This is why I didn't want to ask you a question, Anon. What was question? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I didn't. I don't need to know anymore. You already confirmed it for me. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I was like, is this the colon capital D guy? Anon? But then you answered it, so there's no point. Don't even answer that question. 
<NEW_TOPIC>

<NEW_TOPIC>
Thank you for the stop inviting me to Minecraft stream. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Tomorrow, we'll be bookshop, roulette, same time, and then John with Pippa, Irie, and Leah at the same time the day after. I haven't done the thumbnail, but I'll do the thumbnail soon. You know, actually, Minecraft, like all this Minecraft, it's just a... It's just an excuse for me to not have to do any thumbnails because I'm actually really lazy at doing thumbnails. You think I should hire somebody to do my thumbnails? I'm so lazy. Graphic design is not my passion. No, but it kills the mood, you know, to open Photoshop and wait 10 seconds for it to launch and then add, like, a number to the top left of the thumbnail. And people tend to click less if there's a freaking number because, like, does Iroh do thumbnails? Iroh edits his thumbnails in in After Effects, so no, he cannot do thumbnails. I'd rather die than have him do my thumbnails. I'll do my own thumbnails. I keep doing my own thumbnails. I'm gonna put all these streams into... into, uh... once the arc concludes... I'll put them all into a... a playlist. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
So you can binge watch it if you like. Yeah, from the very beginning. Uh-huh. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
If a playlist... Yeah, sorry. Yusa! Yusa, I'm sorry. I'll put it on a playlist and I'll number it... Uh... in the title instead of in the thumbnail. I don't know how many hours I've played. How many hours have I played? Because I played a little bit off-stream before I started. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
So it's not like I started from... nothing. And I started streaming it. Quick question! After this, would you be changing games completely or just change to another modpack? I don't wanna, like... I don't wanna just completely transition into a Minecraft streamer as much as I wanna do that. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I wanna play some regular games. I'm not... Uh... I don't know. I'll take a break 
<NEW_TOPIC>
and then I'll go into another modpack. How does that sound? How does that sound? Oh, and I'm gonna close the game yet? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Oh my god, I don't wanna close the game. What is... What is the... What is the button to like... check... uh... the... to check how many... hours you've put into the game? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Alright, statistics. Here we go. It's not over yet. There's still like two-ish streams ago. I've flown 103 kilometers. I've flown more than I've sprinted or swum. Sprinted. Yeah, I've flown more than I sprinted. I've dealt 23,000 damage. I love numbers. I've taken 5600 damage. I've quit the game 32 times. Alright, where is this? Time since last rest? 10 minutes? Time played 3.34 days? So that's... 24 by 3?

<NEW_TOPIC>
I would, I would, ah I would have more hours if maybe I don't know, I think I think maybe I should slow down next time So people can play with me I feel like I feel like people don't play the game Because I've just gone too far And like It's kind of difficult to catch up with Somebody who plays all the time All day, every day And like Not leave any room for learning So I feel, I actually feel kind of bad about that And like, I don't I don't know, maybe next time Maybe next time I play I'll play on a single player world Or if it's a If it's a group Minecraft session Then I'll play slow, slower I was too sweaty Maybe that's it But 
<NEW_TOPIC>
