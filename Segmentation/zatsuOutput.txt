Listen to be a vtuber you have to have gone through a phase in your life That's turned you into an irredeemable woman whose only solace is to become a vtuber To be a vtuber you have to be severely broken at one point That's all of us in phase connect you gotta you ha you gotta have a specific criteria uh You gotta fulfill a particular criteria to become a vtuber and that criteria is not that great That's why so many of us are so similar Favorite ship the ice cream factory ship in world war ii that's a thing That's a thing That's a freaking thing That's insane Vtuber die I think I think Because there's a lot of girls who are not Actually, no i'm just projecting this is just a projection.

<NEW_TOPIC>
I'd rather spend three days on a private island with... Are we talking like... Because this is gonna be way better for networking. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
What am I gonna freaking do with my best friend? It's not gonna... It's... If I'm gonna be... If I'm gonna be a big... An important person. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I would need important people by my side. Right? Right? So this would be the more intelligent option. Jelly, stop. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
You're gonna get me in trouble. What? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Hello? You still there? Which is more true of you? When I sit down to think about the ideas of others... I often find myself improving on them... In novel and unexpected ways. When I sit down to think about the ideas of others... I often find that... 
<NEW_TOPIC>
They do not make as much sense as my own ideas. It's pretty... 
<NEW_TOPIC>
It's pretty... It's an interesting question. Because when I think... When I sit down and think about the ideas of others... 
<NEW_TOPIC>
It's not the first thing that comes to my mind. Right? I think about... I think about... 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Why this person's idea... Does not work as well as it should. And... Whether... 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Any other idea would be better. And I... Okay. I guess I try... 
<NEW_TOPIC>
To... Improve on them. A little bit better. Which is more true of you. While I am a good listener... I'm definitely at my best... When I can be allowed to speak up and spar with others. While I am a good speaker... I'm definitely at my best... When I can be allowed to collect myself... And concentrate on what I want to say. Dealing with people can be unpleasant... 
<NEW_TOPIC>
But people themselves... Can never be awful or horrible. No way. Some people are just... Born... Born... Born bad. Thank you so much. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I'm in a super. No way, dude. People are... Some people are literally just bad to the core. Which is more true of you. I've been known to let administrative things... Like insurance and tax returns... Fall through the cracks. I'm somewhat compulsive... About staying on top of administrative things... Like insurance and tax returns. What does this mean? Like I do my taxes... 
<NEW_TOPIC>
And I do administrative things... Like insurance. This is... This means I forget to do them. And this means I... 
<NEW_TOPIC>
This means I... This means I forget... And this means I don't forget. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Jelly, do you think some people are better than others? Yeah, straight up. They're just born different. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
You pay your bills on time. Yeah, the first... 
<NEW_TOPIC>
All the time. I would rather be familiar and conversant... With all manner of different ideas... Or pursue a select few ideas... Or interests... Until I feel like... Feel that I have mastered them... 
<NEW_TOPIC>
All the way from top to bottom. I guess this... I'm good at... I like to be versatile. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I like to be versatile. Hi, how's it going? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I'm good, man. I'm just doing the murderous villain test... Because somebody in chat told me to. Jelly, why does my YouTube auto-play your stream... 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Right after political videos? That's just your algorithm. Do you ignore it... 
<NEW_TOPIC>
When someone cuts in front of you in line? Hell nah, dude. Kill yourself. Which is more true of you? Although I enjoy seeing friends one-on-one... I find it more stimulating... To hang out with several people at once. Although I enjoy the libeliness of a group setting... 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I tend to seek out one-on-one conversation... And often end up in one even within a group. How do I do this? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I'm not very often in groups. How do I say neither? I'm not really sure. I guess one-on-one... No, but I'm talking to you, right? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
So that's a group. Okay. How about this? Do I like to hang out with multiple people... Or do I... Do I like to hang out with people one-on-one? I'm really awkward one-on-one. I'm genuinely so awkward one-on-one. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
If a sign says no smoking... If I have to hang out with people one-on-one... No you don't... I don't actually understand where it's going, cause I throwing off your chin and serve kids. Here's the team. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
If a science is no smoking? I don't think I would. What? But I don't think I would. It's because I'm gonna get fined. If I smoke, it's so stupid. To do something as simple as... It's so silly to break the rules for fun. Tempted. Part of me would be tempted. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Would I be tempted? But I don't even smoke. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I literally do not even smoke. You can be honest. I am honest. I am honest. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I wouldn't smoke. Thank you, David. But it's so bad. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
The cute BGM always makes these moments funnier. But I wouldn't. I wouldn't even. Okay. So if there's a part of me that would click on this. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
That even considered clicking on this top button. Then it's over for me, right? I more often think to myself that... People overcomplicate things. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
The world isn't that complex. People oversimplify things. Have a little more nuance. My mood changes frequently and rapidly. I would rather discover a new scientific concept. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Why would I even learn a freaking dead language? Are you insane? Are you dumb? What a friend or your lies. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
The world would be a better place if more people were more logical. You tend to be what people expect you to be because you want to be liked. This is a pick me! Wait, am I reading the clarinet? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
You tend to be what people expect you to be because you want to be... Yeah, sure, of course. In social situations, I'm probably closer to being... 
<NEW_TOPIC>
You sometimes keep old planner movie tickets as memorabilia. Sometimes... 
<NEW_TOPIC>
No, what the heck? That's horrid. I feel better about... Knowing I have the freedom to change course or careers when it suits me. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Knowing I've planned... Which statement do you agree with more? Oh my god! I'm generally pretty sensitive to all the various music, noise, and advertising images that are invariably thrown in my face over the course of a normal day. I wish public life was less tangled up in all those stimuli. I don't really like all the music, noise, and advertising images that are thrown in my face over the course of a normal day. But then again, who does? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
It's not something that's worth getting upset over. I like advertising. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I like advertising. I'm struggling to understand this question. I'm struggling to understand this question. I wish public life was less tangled up in all those stimuli. Do I? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I wish public life was less tangled up? I guess I do. I do. I do. I would rather it not. I would rather do things and sit around analyzing them. Most of my analysis is done in the shower. Most of my thinking is done in bed or in the shower. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I would say I have a pretty level distribution of when I do things and when I analyze things. I like some advertising. I like some advertising. What is I targeted? Because what is the point in not liking advertising? Right? Like you're not gonna be able to stop it. Advertising is just gonna get in your face way worse. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
So what's what is the point in getting upset about it? It's going to it's only going to keep getting worse. I mean I have ad block. Look I literally have ad block in my browser. But like I don't like it when it's like in when it like interrupts my content. I guess. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I block ads whenever I can and I will Fed post against advertisers. But look as a company right? As a company you have to look. You have to look at this from like a seller's perspective. It's because you're a consumer. If you look at it from a seller's perspective. You would also advertise to make your business be more known. Right? So they are paying money. They're paying money to advertise their business to you. Because they think that you will like it. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
We as FaZe also does ads. Right? So. And because of some ads. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Because of some of the ads you've discovered. FaZe. Not on seller's side so I don't care. But you have to look at it from as many angles as possible. You can't just be close minded. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
And only look at it from your consumer angle. Because everybody is different. And everybody has. A different. Like a different need. A different goal. If I was an advertiser. I would simply make interesting ads. That's what I'm talking about. Interesting ads. Like there are ads that are good. There are ads that are bad. But to reject all ads. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Is. A little close minded. In my opinion. I do have ad blocker. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Because I don't like it when ads are invasive. But when they're not invasive. I think they're fine. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
So what plushie did you want to make? I. I. I. You know what Kusa. You know what Kusa. Alright guys. We don't know Kusa. Kusa is this plushie maker. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Who like makes crocheted plushies on Twitter. You know what Kusa. Sometimes. Sometimes I wish. I wish. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I wish you never met me. I wish you never met me. So I could contact you. And get a plushie made. But now that you know me. I can't get you to make. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
A plushie of my favorite anime character anymore. Because you're gonna be like. That's jelly. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
And I'm gonna be embarrassed. Sometimes. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Sometimes I wish. I wish. I wish. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I wish we never met. I think about this all the time. I think about this all the time. I think about it all the time. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I can't even get a ship to my house. Because then I'd be doxing myself. This sucks so bad dude. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
You can use a third man. I guess. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Yeah. True. No. But the character. Like is so obscure. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
That the second the character gets made. It's gonna be like. Oh my god. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
That's Jelly's favorite character. It's gonna be over for me. It's over for me. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
It's gonna be over. Whatever. Okay. What are we doing? I'd rather do things. And sit around analyzing them. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Can I analyze them. And get somebody else. To do it for me. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Yeah. I'd rather do that. So. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I would analyze things. And somebody else would do it for me. What things just do. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Because if you just do without thinking. You are gonna. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
You're gonna risk wasting time. Jelly. Jelly. You can order the plushie to FaZe Warehouse. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
And ask them to send it over. I don't want to reveal my character. My favorite character. To Kusa. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
It's gonna be over for me. I don't know. I really don't know about that question. Which describes you better? I move at a very fast pace. To make sure I don't get bored. I move at a deliberate pace. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
To make sure I can concentrate. Thank you. But that's not the problem. That's not the problem here. The problem is. The problem is. The problem is. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
The problem is. Me. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
What? Hell no. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I would rather read a book about philosophy. What? What? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Do you know how little that narrows it down? What do you mean? What do you mean by that? Just request like five plushies. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
So they won't know who is the actual one. I'll think about it. I'll think about it. I'll think about it. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I'm getting a middleman. It's pretty. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
It's pretty good. It's a pretty good. Yeah. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Getting a middleman is pretty good. Okay. Okay. Why would I read a book about sports? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I don't care about sports. Which is more true of you. Sometimes things aren't really true for me until I've read them in a book. Sometimes things aren't really true for me until I've experienced them myself. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
The best guide to human action is principles. Otherwise people could justify anything. Values. It is important to be authentic about who you are. What is principles and what is values? Truth? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Worth? Wait, what? Isn't this the same thing? Judgment? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Principles or rules? Okay. Rules are crazy important. Thank you, Sanaki, for the super. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Are you trying to play more awful games with cringe writing like Dragon Age Veil Guard? You know, flaming games publicly on stream? Completely transparent here. But flaming games publicly on stream is not that great for a streamer. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Especially a streamer my size because it's basically... I don't know. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I think... I think... It... It's a bad look. For sponsorships? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
And I kind of want sponsorships. So I don't... I would rather not like, you know, blow myself up. Old school ads are at least funny. Now they're dull and preachy. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
One after the other over and over. Makes me want to avoid the brand. Thank you for the super. Makes sense. Yeah, it makes me a brand risk. And I'm... 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I'm under face connect, right? I don't... I wouldn't want to like... 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I wouldn't want to... I wouldn't want to ruin anything. You know? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
In general, I think that more of society as well should be taxed from the rich and... Which is more true of you? I have a high activity level and live a diverse and varied life. I have a somewhat lower activity level. But knowing this... 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I concentrate my activities around the things that really matter to me. Did I... Did I answer the right question? I clicked... I clicked the right thing last... Last round, right? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I clicked on the right thing, right? Yeah, yeah, 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I did. Okay. Um... You picked the communist option? No? What the hell? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
What the hell would I be a communist? Um... I have a high... I have a high activity level and live a diverse and varied life. I have a somewhat lower activity level. But knowing this, I concentrate my activities around things that really matter actually. What genius would you rather have? Easy. What the heck would I be... Would I be a genius in writing? I'm better at improvising. Your neighbor is playing music. It's way too loud. You need to need quiet to prepare for tomorrow. Shut up. Most people really want to help others. I don't even know if I can do this. I'm not comfortable contacting him. So I try to endure it instead. I'm pretty... 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I'm pretty bad at that. So... Yeah. I would... I would love to knock on his door and tell him to shut up. But I'm... To be completely honest, I'm kind of... I would call the cops. I wouldn't directly confront him. I would call the cops. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Why is there no call the cops option? Most people really want to help others. Good one. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
In resolving conflicts, which approach do you more often find yourself taking? It annoys me more when people are overly vague. Dude, this is like... This pisses me off, like, majorly. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
This is like my biggest pet peeve. Like, instead of just telling me straight up... Instead of telling me straight up... 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Do you really have to be around the bush? Just tell me, dude. Just tell me. It's not that hard. I freaking hate it. I'm more of a night owl. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I've been waking up really early recently, though. Yeah, anyways. People that... People that are vague... Are... 
<NEW_TOPIC>
The worst kind of people. And it basically... 
<NEW_TOPIC>
It's basically like a deal breaker for, like... A friendship. I cannot... 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Absolutely cannot vibe with people that are vague. I... Just... If you're upset with me, just tell me. Don't... Please don't be around the bush. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
It makes me so mad. And... 
<NEW_TOPIC>
And... And... And... Okay, I can't be sexist. Which is more true of you? I'm more oriented towards closure. And I push to get things settled and decided. I wait to see so that I'm adaptable and free. I keep my opinions open. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Yeah, I already implied it. So you don't... So I don't need to say it. Um... How do you feel about multitasking? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I'm proud of making mistakes when I multitask. What? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Shall we speak up? Don't be vague. Okay. In this situation, I must be vague. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Else I will be... Persecuted. Prosecuted? What's the difference? Prosec... Prosec... Prosecuted. I'll be prosecuted. Persecuted? Persecuted? Prosecuted is like law. What about persecuted? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I'll be persecuted. Okay. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I'll be persecuted. Fashionable? Like trendy? I don't know what... I don't know what the heck is trendy. But I don't feel awkward when people say I look nice. Julie, hating being... Hating being faked and argues. She must act fake. Do you know that I am in front... 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Do you know that whatever... Do you know that this is a stream? It's different when I'm like talking to somebody face to face. But... When you are... 
<NEW_TOPIC>
In a call with somebody... Or when you're speaking... Or when there's... Or when there might be... Evidence of your actions... 
<NEW_TOPIC>
You must be vague to avoid... Your... What you're saying... 
<NEW_TOPIC>
To be used against you. But it doesn't really matter... Because you already know what I'm thinking... 
<NEW_TOPIC>
And I've already played Dustborn. So what? So what now? I just don't want to say it. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
It's different when I do it? Yeah. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I'm a... I'm a... I'm a... 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I'm a hypocrite. And? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
And? And? What? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
We lost the plot. What were we talking about? Wait. We were talking about me being vague because... There's no way. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
There's no way you heard what I said... And then... And then not got the point. I sometimes worry that people will give me... My fair share of recognition and credit... For the work I contribute. Which is more often true of you. Someone asked me a question... Doesn't give me enough time to think of an answer... Before they resume talking. I ask someone a question... And get impatient... 
<NEW_TOPIC>
When they don't match my conversational pace. Dang it! I'm a super!

When solving a problem, I prefer to steer directly towards accomplishing the goal and bringing the task to completion or keep my options open. Maybe something unexpected will come along. I don't think I'm a murderous villain. I generally don't think I'm a murderous villain. Do I keep my options open? I just generally like to just do things, man. Just finish it and get it over with.

Demanded a level of efficiency and work ethic of others that they might not have been capable of delivering which was not natural to them? Oops! Use their natural leadership and organizational skills to claim the mantle and assert yourself as leader of something without making sure that this was in accordance with the wishes of the other parties involved. Okay, not yet. Exhibited intense loyalty to your friends and family and put your resources and cunning to the work of aiding them even when they might not have deserved it. Actually, close.

I didn't cheat in any of my exams until online learning became a thing. Only when they decided, hey, do your tests at home. Only then did I realize everybody around me cheated. So it's stupid for me to not cheat. You cheat on your girlfriend? I don't have a girlfriend. More likely than the average person to leave an orderly room when you go to work. Okay, I'm not orderly at all. I'm not cold-headed. And I'm not attached. I'm pretty attached. Oh my god, dude. Am I this cold?

<NEW_TOPIC>
More at ease of making cynical and tough decisions? Okay, now I feel really bad. Just kidding, I don't. More likely than the average person to be barbed and acerbic.

Sometimes I feel less successful compared to others on social media. I have a strong moral compass. Hell nah. I don't need to be committed to a person. Hell nah. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Everything that exists can in the final instance be boiled down to the laws of physics. I'm open to certain things being different. Or certain things changing. I don't know if we've discovered everything yet. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
But in this state that we are in then yes. I think so. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Sometimes I consume food or beverages to the point of... I'm someone who craves the thrill of immediate action. I do. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Extra marital affairs are alright. Even when one's partner doesn't know about them. What the hell? People spend too much time on introspection nowadays. Like... Like self-reflection. I think people should reflect on themselves more actually before they... I think people should reflect on themselves more often before they post on Twitter. So I think people don't spend enough time. I spread rumors around people. People spread rumors. Are... Snakes. Snakes. And should die. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I prioritize short-term satisfaction over my long-term goals and well-being. Um... A good balance. I lie or mislead others to get what I want. Like the face connect edition? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Science should be seen as equal to other social ins... Good one. Wait. Good one, dude. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I'm satisfied with what I have in life. Yeah. Alright. Alright. I would be tempted... 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I would be tempted to use counterfeit money. If not even... If I were sure I could get away with it. No? If I were sure I could get away with it, I would do it. It's challenging for me to do something enjoyable even when I know it's time to stop. Like making music past 2am. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Like making music past 2am. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I'm honest and upfront with others even when it's difficult. Yeah. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Up front. Most of the time. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Unless like you know... Unless like maybe fringe cases. Like... They're really sensitive about their music. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
They're 14 years old and this is their first FL Studio song. And they show it to me and it sucks complete garbage. But they're so sincere about it. Obviously, I should tell them that it's good and they should keep going. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
If I oppose the election of a politician, I would be glad to see them fail. Huh? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I'm not sure. Can't tell you. Yeah, but you gotta call garbage garbage. Listen. I am only here where I am today because people listened to my garbage back in the day when I first made music. And they said it was good and I should keep going. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
That is what made me continue making music. Right? If people have called... 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I was dancing when I was a kid and the teacher said I sucked and I never danced again. Sometimes there are things that you should not be brutally honest about. Especially when somebody is just starting out learning something. I struggle to control my anger. True. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I struggle to control my cravings. Not really. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. If I'm split between two products I want, the ideal outcome would be me owning them both. Depends on the type of product. If it's like a hair product, then I'll use one and then I'll use the other one. If it's like headphones, then I'll only pick one. What do you crave, Jerry? I want to eat, but I'm on a diet. You know that kind of cravings? I feel like I'm...

I'm pretty good at controlling cravings. Like some of them. Most of them actually. I don't eat any snacks even though I want to. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I don't eat any snacks even though I want to. You sound like the blue haired anime girl from Phase Connect. Hi! My name is Jeldy, aw aw aw aw. My name is Jeldy. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Waw aw aw aw... 
<NEW_TOPIC>
But if you have enough money for both- It's like... for both, then I would get both. Calming techniques? Who does that? Calming techniques? Who does that? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I think that engaging with life with enthusiasm feels pointless due to the potential for future sorrow. It's always important to enjoy things in the moment, you know? I have changed. I am now reformed. I think it's important. I think it's important to be happy while you can. What the hell? Acting negatively toward others out of spite or resentment? I don't actually hate anybody. Do I? I only dislike people. But when I dislike them, I just simply do not engage. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I just do not engage. Do you hate us? I do! 
<NEW_TOPIC>
You hate fictional characters? Does that count? Do you hate us? Do you hate us? I do! Do you hate fictional characters? Does that count? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
It's different because fictional characters don't have feelings, but real people do. I do hate the same thing. I don't really like... I don't really like acting negatively because that shows weakness, you know? I don't really like... Ah, sorry. I don't really like acting negatively because that shows weakness, you know? It's like you're weak to them. And when you're weak to them and when you hate them and when you actively post hate comments and when you anti them, you lose. Because they live in your head rent free. I appreciate the qualities and successes of others. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Seeing them as an inspiration for my own growth. I... I do. I do. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
My friends, when they are successful, I'm happy for them. What the hell? Making a lot of money is one of my most important goals. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I do like money. I can enjoy hurting others. I gotta think about this. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Julie, why did you punch us in the ear? I'm sorry. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I... My... My, um... My cable for my mic is a bit old. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
So when I, like, move it, it sometimes does that. If it's consensual... Oh yeah, if it's consensual, then it's fine. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
It's okay to lie... Since you never know who you can... So true. Human beings are nothing more than complicated biological machines. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
What kind of freaking question is this? Oh yeah, okay. I did the good. I picked it correctly. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I thought I picked it on the... On the far end of the agree cycle. The hell is this? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
We're all just flesh Gundams for our brains? The hell? I don't really think about this. I don't think it matters. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
At times, I find it hard to be genuinely happy for others when they achieve something I desire. Yeah, everybody does. It's jealousy. It's natural. I focus on my personal progress and milestones. Understanding that comparing myself to others is mostly a fool's errand. Hell nah! If you don't compare yourself to others, you do not know what the measure for success is. The best way to measure success is when you are in a race with somebody else. So does this mean it's disagree? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Why base your own success on others? What do you mean? Because that is the measure. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Everybody else around you. Doing the same thing as you. Is. A measure for success. That's destructive thinking. It's worked so far. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
How do you know success if you don't know what's the benchmark? Something like that, I guess. It's like. Like. Like I used to compare with my. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Compare myself with peers that started at the same time as me. And. Yeah. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I don't know. I think. I think. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I think it's good. It's healthy competition. You know. Benchmark is your past self. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
No. No. No. If you grow at your own pace. You will never push yourself. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
You will never be able to push yourself. If you do not compare yourself. If you are. If you are. Okay. Let's take. Let's. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Let's think about sports. Right. If you're a runner. How do you know you are fast? Just because you are faster than you were yesterday. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Does not mean you are fast. Does that make sense? You compare yourself. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
With people who are also running. But don't let it get too hard. Too much into your head. Because you can. You grow at your own speed. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
You'll never be fast enough. Yeah. That's it. That's life. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
You'll never be good enough. And that's how we live. And. Life is about. Understanding. Accepting that you will never be the best. In what you do. But it's okay to continue to. Try to achieve it. Because. Maybe one day. You can become the best at what you do. Humans. Without ambition. Without a goal. Are. Dead. Something like that. I mean. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I mean. I mean. Personally. I like to compare myself. Because. I like to be competitive. I've always been. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Sort of competitive. But I don't like that. Get too much into my head. Because. It's unhealthy. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
If. It's all you obsess about. But. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I like being competitive. Because. It's. It's fun and exciting. When. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I can reach my goals. You know. Life is a highway. What the heck does that even mean? Life. Life is a highway. Life. Life is a. Life is a highway. Yeah. Life is a highway. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Highway. To hell. Yeah. Does that. Does that. Does that make. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Does that. Does that make. Does that make sense? My ego is not frill enough. That I cannot recognize. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
When someone is better than me. Or something. Okay. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
That makes a lot of sense. Actually. Yeah. Sometimes it's better. To just accept that people are better than you. But it's not wrong. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
To compare yourself. To them. Because it. Promotes. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Growth. I guess. It's hard to be. What the hell is that super chat? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
What the hell is that super chat? Bro. Bro. Bro. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
You're gonna get yourself banned. Come on. It's funny. But don't say that again. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Oh. Oh. Oh. Racers.

<NEW_TOPIC>
That's a typo on your end. Okay. That's fine. That's fine. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
But don't say that word. It's. It's not a. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
We're not racist. Okay. Okay. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Okay. All right. Just between you and me. Life is like a box of chocolate. I'm normal. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I'm normal. Actually, no. I'm not. Thank you, Madass. For the two-sup. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
It's a waste of time to consider other people's viewpoints. As I'm almost always right. Actually, it's the opposite. Because I'm a woman. Thank you, Karikor. I'm a suba. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Following rules and planning for the future seem restrictive and stifling to my freedom. Not really. Not really. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I think it's. I think it. I think you have to plan a little bit. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Breaking promises or betraying confidence feels justified to me if it gets me what I want. They're fringe cases. They're fringe cases. Like if somebody said, Hey, can you tell me this trade secret? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I'll give you a billion dollars. I will do it. In like a heartbeat. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Even though I promised Sakuna that I would not leak his trade secret. But if somebody offered me a million dollars, you bet I am leaking that. I can pay for the legal fees with a million dollars. What if you have an NDA? I can pay for the legal fees. If the guy is like, Tell me. I'll pay for your legal fees. I'll be like, Yeah, yeah, man. Sure. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
This will be brought up in court. Yeah. And? It's not like I didn't do it. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Can you even be sent to jail for breaking an NDA? I guess it depends on like... Okay, okay, okay. How about this? Okay, there's no NDA. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
He just said, Don't tell anybody. And I said, Okay, I promise. And then somebody's like, Hey, can you tell me? I'll give you like $500,000. I would tell them. Oh, it's just money? Just damages? Okay, yeah. That's a French case, right? 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I'll be sued to poverty? Dude. Yeah, it's all about whether the money they're offering me is greater than what I'll be losing. No, it's not a face. Can I can't sue me for a million dollars? The biggest problem with breaking NDAs isn't the cost, but it's reputational damage. I take the money and then never come back. But nobody would trust you? Who cares? I'm never coming back. Thank you, Blank, for the 10. Life did not give us lemons. We crossbreed them ourselves. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
You gotta make your own success. Life isn't gonna hand it to you. Deep and true. She actually is Saddam Hussein. Typical woman bought with money. Okay, tip. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Okay. Okay. True? I'm like rubbing my chin as if I have anything on my chin. 
<NEW_TOPIC>

<NEW_TOPIC>

<NEW_TOPIC>
Ok, dismay your chin I mean, it would be stupid to not take the money. t- 
<NEW_TOPIC>

<NEW_TOPIC>
I mean, if you're giving me more money than I'll ever make in my life, I would be stupid to not take it. Yeah, hypothetical question. I wouldn't know. I wouldn't know. I couldn't tell you. Sorry, I keep bumping into my microphone. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
But Jelly, there could be a chance that you could make that kind of money. But you're giving, but that's just a chance. But that's just a chance. Okay, I reflect on my responses to conflicts to learn how I can handle similar situations more calmly in the future. 
<NEW_TOPIC>

<NEW_TOPIC>
I tend to act on impulse sometimes. What the hell? Yeah. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I often feel like a victim of circumstance, unable to control my own happiness. I used to be like this. 
<NEW_TOPIC>

Average. I can't say it. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
But. But. Well. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
Average woman. But well. I've learned that. Fate is in your hands. You can jump for the beef. You can rank up to be a pro. When someone achieves something great, I feel motivated and inspired rather than diminished by what they have accomplished. I don't really feel anything. I don't really care. 
<NEW_TOPIC>
I'll be upset if my success came at someone else's expense. Not really, but depends.
