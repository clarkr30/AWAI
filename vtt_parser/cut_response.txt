One would like this move.
Would get disintegrated by the lava and then this will break the kick, is over here, thank you, Cat.
Boy, yeah, like jelly; ew, Rose, oh man, thank you, Malcolm for you save all your Ms pit notes; combine them later to make a merch with esoteric Vibes that is insane.
I didn't save any unfortunately but you're giving me some merch ideas.
Yeah, this one would work.
This one would work, but only if...
There's a hedge here right so this one doesn't work because...
Because because... the previous level was solved differently this one there is no space to solve to put this of the evening.
Jolly not what the other way is to get kek to late; the second kick is me, the second kick becomes you.
Baba would still be locked into Baba's move; no if you could push Kek that would be way easier.
I have tried making K break Baba, you didn't work.
Melt the box so you wouldn't be able to change K; you you won't be able to change k, k is you and Baba is K at the same time.
Because you're not able to move; you have to move two spaces to turn it into something else like over here like Baba is you or Kek is you.

You would have to have Baba's move for that to happen because you can only move this you over here if you don't have Baba's move but if you have Baba's move then you can move in two spaces in one turn.
That wouldn't make any sense though; that wouldn't make any sense now it is able to change baa is you at the same time.
I would need one more is for this to work actually thank you, mi welcome to the please enjoy your day.

I need either one more movable Baba or welcome more w. 
See what I mean thought true I'm not sure if this is even possible what I think it's supposed to be like that I think it's nice.
But yeah you get it right what I'm trying to do; on no no no, I would still need two Bas for this.

Once at once Pap's let's turn back to Kek eventually baa is just to the right.
Works.
Oops.
Oops hold on.
Wait what no way no oh my God it's fine.
Oh my God my God oh my God this doesn't work man.
There's no way there's no way fingers what the heck was that solution dude there is no way what was that I don't even know what happened.
Yay we did it for that what cost.
It's not that hard it was it was pretty hard, was it?
Not pretty hard.
