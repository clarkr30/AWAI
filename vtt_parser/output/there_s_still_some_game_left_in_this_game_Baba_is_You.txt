somebody's game and then adds the
developer on Twitter and says nice game
if I was a Dev I'd be like bro you
haven't even finished my game yet why
did you why' you say nice game you know

I've got to get all achievements in the
game you play Baba you extreme out 10
levels and quit no no no no no no no no
no no no no no I'm I'm no weakling how
how hard can a puzzle be am I right
can't be that
hard
hot okay this flag is win
Isis
flag Isis Isis melt Isis flag we need to
do Baba is
hot but skull is
defeat ah I
see that's
insane how long were you on that one
level again I don't want to talk about
it
okay I get it I get it so we need do
Baba is word Baba is you and Baba is hot
so what the heck is that rock for oh
pull H okay okay okay I got it okay okay
I got it so we got to lock one of these
Bros in
okay we're locked in
I we can't go to the
right how's that possible
then we got lock it in over to the right
side premature lock
init
what okay so so so so so the sentences
we got to make is Baba is float Baba is
you Baba is hot and Baba is
word so there's one over here one Baba
over here which means we have got to
have one regular Baba up
here and then we got to do one Baba
is what the heck
man it's can't be that hard
there's like some indents over at the
top which is for I I presume to make
these
words so what if we
did we can do this right this is
possible let's restart we can do this I
think
what the heck this one's got to be one
up I
that no but now now it doesn't fit in
the what the
what the what the what what the what
what the what what the
what is this supposed to happen
ah H what
if what
if what if
imagine
imagine imagine
imagine wait this is really hard I don't
know how to navigate through this maze
without like breaking
something how
okay we probably have to do this like
um okay so we'll stick one Baba in
here so when when it's down
here we need it to float
and go to the
how oh wait
wait
what no the point of the rock is to lock
in the baba but there's like three slots
up there
right if I lock in the Baba
whatever oh my God I'm so
confused oh my God I'm so confused no I
I could get a third baba but but
but but what is the
point if I got a third Baba right
I got a third Baba right what is the
point of
this really can you put a job on your
shirt it can't do
D can't do
CH can do
JS congrats on your adorable than it
this yes thank
you how do you get to force
Baba what the heck I don't know if this
is the right configuration for
this there's another is for some reason
think it this large Al a l out what
I feel like I I kind of feel like this
might not be the best config I'm so
stupid I just
realized I've got to be like L IQ or
something I've got to be like low IQ for
sure
I
no okay okay okay
thank you eat voice for two mons are you
so cute jelly ah thank
you wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
wait wait wa wait
wait oh I see
see this is so stupid this is actually
unbelievably
stupid I see I see I see I
see I
see I see I see I
see I see I see I see I see so
clearly it's got to be the other way got
to be like from down to
up it's got to be from down to
up
you I just avoided $10,000 in taxes
let's freaking go are you sure you
should be telling me this
sec baa is
word no way
does it matter whether Baba is you or
Baba is I prefer Baba is you to be stuck
there does this matter wait what am I
supposed to okay so so Baba
is you is stuck there and then we have
do Baba is word I mean NE works right
okay I don't like this though it's like
different no
J I just heard really loud thunder
outside is scary oh no it's okay just
turn up my stream really really loud I
promise I won't blow your ears out more
than the Thunder did or
will
wait I guess Baba's word is equally as
important right but like now I'm locked
in to the
right it's going to be Baba is
word and then Baba's you
somewhere okay let's go back I just
realized something really
stupid thank you
CA if I make a clay figurine out of you
what outfit would you like like whatever
is easier for you actually I really
Havey you want to though that's
nice whatever is easier I I would assume
that this is easier
what um
okay Baba is
you right and then we'll P your baba is
word and then we'll pull this one
stop distracting me when I'm trying to
do my Baba
level okay okay so so once we lock in
Baba is you I mean Baba is
word yeah once we lock
in Baba is you and Baba is
word then we got to do Baba is hot
why do we have an extra is what is the
point of this extra is there's got to be
a point there's got to be a reason that
gave us one extra
is there's got to be a
reason there's got to be a
reason she doesn't know or did not know
oh what if it's like if it's like what
if there isn't there's got to be there's
got to
this hydy distra ing Super Chat nice try
I'm too locked in to be distracted
now it's hot it's
hot it's
hot this still doesn't make sense this
still doesn't make sense this doesn't
make any sense this makes no sense
this makes no sense get it
twisted I don't remember the full line
for that then you for the five M
everybody Welcome to stream oh
come come
wel okay dude Baba is word
you've got to push it
down oh snap it's got to be down
that it's got to be down and this word
is got to be up I think this is
unchangeable thank you s very super
well Jer we don't know can't make her a
sad
girl I'm not sad I'll never be
okay this is insane
man oh my God it's crazy
wait this is this is this is really
weird if I were to do this right I mean
I have
to go one
right let go right like
that went
down wait what the heck no it's going to
be oh my God what what the heck
dude wait what's going on does it have
to be is you
oh so it's that be like that
what a freaking CLE
B it's com be like
this and then we got to push his word
down where's something
which means that that's got to be one
block to the
right you find does it make sense you
know Jobo before s was invented we only
use
dollars what
it's what the heck wait I I got it just
now but I don't remember the
configuration
oh my
God so much thank
you of
green you're
cool you're
cool
okay okay let's just think about this
I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to
sit back and I'm going to
sink I'm going drink some tea it's cold
now and
disgusting I'm going to
think what about my configuration is
wrong it's got to be is word has got to
be down here
and there's got to be a baba over here
and this configuration doesn't make
sense so it should be Baba is you up
there but that also doesn't make
sense so we got to push the whole thing
up what by
one and then stack two Bubbas
am I stupid thank
you jell is the best B Tu I know she's
St because she is sentimental about
spending 2 hours in a single puzzle yeah
that's totally it that's totally
it w
epic
okay epic epic
epic
epic okay now this is kind of
what the
heck oh wait no I don't I don't have to
oh this is
okay we got to do it like over here got
to make sure this one's higher up then
this
one okay so so this
so this one's got to be all the way up
here and this one's got to be all the
way down
here nothing more than I should
do but it's still ends up being all the
way down because I
fful with the Sila here's two American
dollars to distract you too bad I didn't
finish a level yay we did it

just died just straight up you
hello what empty's not move empty not

empty's push what the heck is an empty
as push
what B
graas goo is goo
come on what the heck did
me I
again I can't I can't I
can'ta dude what what is going on I
don't get it I don't get it I don't get
it thank you co s it's you know the
symbol m in McDonald's represents the
first letter in McDonald's which is
M no that's just it's not an M it's it's
not it's not a letter M it's two arches
it's
different no ha
English
no no wait
what no hav ESP
no no
ESP no
hav hav oh
no face
yes me first m
I should uh I should du a lingo this I
should get I should do a dual lingo
stream I think that would be that would
be PE
content I didn't how to solve
this I don't know where to
start do you know two archers and
McDonald logo represents the first
letter in McDonald's which is M wow
crazy
insane okay is there something is there
something I got to
do
okay what what what that stuff at the
top is all a bit
what up what
up good one L thank you's easy we learn
Spanish drink
tequila is tequila
Spanish
imagine no but every empty k kills you
right every empty kills
you every empty kills you and pip is
stop if every okay if every empty kills
you
then then I wouldn't be able to make it
over here
anyways so there must be a different
way to get past this
unless you stack yourself no you would
still die because you'd be near
empty if it was Baba on MTS de feed like
that would make more that that would be
a bit easier yes tequila is from Mexico
so yes Spanish wow what about vodka
where's vodka from
where's where's where's uh where's
where's what
where's what is jacket with whiskey
where's whiskey from
Russia where's whiskey whiskey from the
liquor store thank you
vodka what the move is ex a single pipe
I can't even get I can't even get there
bro I like literally die if I get there
if I if I walk over
here Scotland oo I like whiskey wait no
I'm say so I hate
drinking where's beer from beer is like
everywhere
right than you son me vtuber what you
cannot push a two piece no I can't it's
stop so there's got to be a way to
uh
is doesn't make sense you're not
supposed to be able to push
empty empty move doesn't work empty is
push doesn't work Bubba is
move also doesn't
work Bubba is push
also doesn't
work so the the closest thing to
something that might work is Baba's push
Baba's move but where the heck is B
moving
uh
what how does this work what
what what
Baba is currently sink but there are no
objects on Baba so Baba is
safe near empty I'm near empty
right
what I'm on empty but being on empty
also means you are in you are near empty
look what's next to me is
empty you can't sink into anything that
makes that makes more sense I think you
need a tow to sink into yeah that makes
a little bit more sense
actually um anyways I'm stuck
here sorry I can't read what you just
said you
I I I can't that's some Advanced
spel dude what
I I can't speak bames

Jer so bad so
bad Okay so
so are we not allowed to change belt to
anything
else and what do we do
star okay so we can't change belt but we
can change
star we can't change belt but we can
change star because belts would ruin
flag is
win so let's make
Star okay now we have star dingy Tong
for the
welcome welcome welcome back pleas you
stay there's also
ha
wait there's also hash we also make
yes
star we can't have ha we can't do star
ha at the same time it's got to be
something has
ghost is Ghost and
stop
um we can't do ghost has either star oh
star has love love is melt and
love star is
melt we can do
hot do Bell is hot
stress
this is so complicated
I think we've done like the easier
version of this the alternate version of
this level this like the alternate
version of another
level
um I don't know where to start there's
too many things too many too many
can we do anything to the to the Belt
can we do anything at all to the
Belt we can't
right we can't make it fall we can only
make it
hot but you don't make it
hot melt is melt you can't we can't make
melt M up
there why not love is hot cuz there's no
love lovess this level is
Loveless is this a game yeah I'm playing
a game called Baba you it's a really fun
game
what is this level called again what do
you want to you want to what you want to
look up the answer for this it's called
meteor strike ABC exra
One Love is
what I think the game is playing you I'm
being played I'm being played
Star as fall yeah but what's the point
you
know I could do star as fall but then it
just fall here right down
here okay okay the whole
thing is basically
thinking
about what to do
here
star is
fall would be here we would want it so
fall
here fall if if this Falls all the way
here we won't be able to reach it
anyways so it could fall
here but then we can't do anything to
skull that's a thing
rat
R ideally we want the belt to change
into something that
doesn't
move but all these things they
rat
rat belus
ghost but then we lock out fall
I think I know the
problem I think I saw the issue I think
I see the issue now
so belt is Ghost and star is
fall has to be during at the same
time I see the
issue so I'm pretty sure last level this
block might not have been there or
somewhere around here must have changed
f is
Ghost and
star is um
belt is g h

do it doesn't push the Rock the this
thing right cuz wall is stop
right got to do something like w like
like wall on rock is
like wall on Rock no no like Baba like
rock on Baba is wall or something like
that it's got to be something like
that so far we've gotten three things we
can do so that that's the only issue
right that's like the only issue getting
wall on everything else we can stack
with no
problem we need two Babas
Babas I'm going to go to the bathroom
hold on I need a I I need an idle break
idle break idle break and I'm going to
get some tea while I'm at it idle
break I'll be right back
idle break idle break I'll be
I'm back I got some tea but it's really
hot so I'm going to wait before I can
drink it
I got to let my teast steep as well well
thank you I'm
back I'm back I'm
back okay back to this garbage back to
this this hell this hell you callor
level
okay just chew on the teabag why can't
you hear a pterodactyl go into the
bathroom because the p is
silent ha
much we can just do
this and then do like
Baba
Baba uh wall wall is Rock
La
is
rock and then
Baba
on
Baba on
rock
is
ball what the heck
wait there we go now we just put
the we just put the rock in the just put
the the wall in the The Rock in the wall
we put the rock in the
wall we'll put the rock in the
wall we put the rock in the wall
we have successfully put the rock in the
wall but how am I going to get Baba onto
the how how is this physically possible
how is this physically possible H how is
this physically possible how is is
physically possible shift shift got got
to shift something got to got to shift
got to got to do the shif in got to
shift all right I've got my glasses on
we're gaming
now caveman
discovers we got to put we we did it we
put the rock in the wall we put the rock
in the wall the wall in the
Rock The Rock in the
wall
insane
okay I don't know what to do I don't
know what to do I don't know
I okay so we put the wall in the Rock by
doing bab on rock is wall but I feel
like wall is got has got to be one of
the last
steps I feel like we might have to shift
the
wall we might have to shift the Rock and
text I mean the wall and text into the
middle we might have to do something
like rock is sh
and then like plant it around the flag
you get
it so I'm just going to like I'm just
going to make these Babas the same thing
cuz it Doesn't it's pretty easy to make
Babas
so let's just focus on doing rockus push
for
now and by Baba's shift for now so we
can actually we don't need to do rock
his push we just need to do Baba's
shift wait a second doesn't this mean I
move really
fast
God God dang
it hi Jerry hope you're still sane
questionable
let's put this somewhere more accessible
like right here right here is pretty
accessible or we could stick it in here
that's pretty
accessible and now we can do
wall
is
W this
Rock what it's phrasing what did I
phrase what what what's what's wrong
with my
phrasing what did I say I don't remember
what I said I don't think it was that
bad what did I
say do you no longer need to Baba I do I
do but it's pretty easy to make Babas
just do a
baba
psych oh
fine but like two Bas just so annoying
you
know it's very annoying to deal with
and now I have to
do this
rock all right and
then what we can do is do Baba is
shift and get a rock onto the flag no
problem Baba into the
flag now the only problem is text and
Baba what I wanted to do
was to
is what I want to do is
this good night jelly and dark kns I'll
be finishing game soon thank you also
your new song is very good and I really
like your new outfit have a good stream
ah thank
you thank you if you guys haven't heard
my new original break into my heart you
should listen to it it's on YouTube just
go on my YouTube and uh click into the
videos section good
night okay
but but
uh I think this should
work if
I oh God two Babas is so annoying
thank if I have five
members thank
you thank you thank you thank you thank
you very
welcome okay so something like this
right and then this will go in like this
this will go in
like
this okay so this now shifts one shifts
up and one shifts
there two stinking
Babas and I I'll have just two stray
down here just so I can use them for
something if I
want and then we'll turn off Rock his
push let's think if we do rocket shift
okay so I'm going to do
this this is really convoluted I don't
know if this is the right
idea these two Babas are seriously
pissing me
off
Baba
on
rock
is wall all
right and then we're going to
plant a
Bubba right about
here all right and then also planned and
is right
about
difficult ah I think I get it it okay so
let's do rocket push
again let's just do rockus push again
and we will do one
down or we could just do one down like
that okay and then we'll do
Baba and then we'll do rock this shift
changing okay let's go back all the way
up
here let's go back
uh I wanted to not swap like
about we go from here to here and we'll
do rock is rock is shift
okay I think we need one extra yeah I
think we need one extra Rock for each of
these let's go back to when I turn Baba
into
wall
rewind and we need to do rock is push
one more
extra here okay and
then we're going to go one
down like that
okay this should
work and
then we'll go back to Baba on
rock is
W we'll turn this into a
wall and
then we will
do we put an is here and then we'll do
rock is shift
before I go and stand
on on the
thing there we
shift somewhere where I can go stand on
the
stuff Jesus this level is psychopathic
man it's Psychopathic straight
up this a psycho level it's for psychos
and I'm not a
psycho no I'm one off
why am I still
oneof yay we did
it
yay yay that was hell that was that was
absolute that was a cool one though that
might have been my favorite level in the
entire game
that was fun maybe maybe maybe not my
favorite level in the entire game but
it's it's up there it's like in in my
top five levels of all time that was
crazy that was a fun

I can do dust as rock but like what do I
achieve
as far as I know I don't know any any
any way to get something out of a
corner you
know as far as I
know is there something after level your
model hides
it oh sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry
sorry I just realized you can't really
see what I'm doing here I'll make
everything smaller so you can see
it oh my God sorry I didn't mean mean I
didn't mean to make it that
small
okay I mean there's barely any
game this the game play is not very
important as long as you can read the
words the game is really not that
important the world is called turn the
corner no that's the level man the level
is called turn the
cor I've already done this right I've
already done
this yeah I've already done that the
world is I'm not sure what that's called
man I'm going to drink some
tea I near only spilled tea all over
myself that would have been bad
it's going to be dust to stop and level
but I'm not sure how to get level out of
that
corner is there something we can do to
this
level I mean level is level why is level
is level maybe there's a maybe there's a
secret to level is
level do you mean coffee no I'm I'm
drinking tea I'm drinking caramel
water
God oh God oh no oh no no no I can
figure this out I can figure this out I
can figure this out if it's the last

this caramel or
camam caramel my favorite
color thank you Dr for four
month I can do this this is nothing for
a genius like me Real Genius
uh self-proclaimed if I'm a
self-proclaimed
genius right then I would assuming that
I really am a genius that means me self-
proclaiming that I'm a genius is
true but if I'm not a genius
and I self-proclaim myself as a
genius that would mean it's not
true but if what's 43 * 2 uh
86 yeah but so so so but if
I yes
bbas you and
rock wait does that turn Baba into rock

fully and into the top left
no dust dust is this orange sparkly
thing that's
dust Rock Dust is
stop dust is
stop
and dust and Rock

rock water is
sink I don't think water is sink is very
useful in the situations I'm going to
ignore that I think we're about the
water part think it's about dust
but how do you get the do
star
dust no
help no dust and
rock
dude how do you
get how do I get something out of the
corner is there a gimmick there's got to
be a gimmick I'm missing there's got to
be like some kind of like gimmick thing
that I'm missing there there's got to
there's got to be some kind of
gimmick I don't believe
it there's got to be some kind of
gimmick
there's got to be something what what
the
heck how how are you supposed to get
level out of
there simply become room temperature IQ
a
s what the sigma
close I'm actually not even close for
jell
Hello nice to meet you
we've done this
one
huh we've done this one we've done huh
get dust get dust is
L
dust
dust oh dust
dust dust
dust we need to get dust dust
dust
dust dust
dust
how
in
the ever
loving
chungus
do
we
achieve dust
is
level
I
am
going
keep
talking really
slowly
to
annoy
u
annoyed right
now
is
this working
please don't tell me there's something I
need to do here thank you Nick for two
months country of origin definition and
can you use it in a sentence what what
does that
mean there's level
there bro what the heck am I supposed to
do with the
level what
where is
hedge where is hedge into oh my God wait
a second
wait a
second wait a second wait a second wait
a
second
no wait what is there to do here there's
something to do here Cactus pushes level
is
weak is hedge stop balls also
here surely there's nothing you can do
here is there actually nothing I can do
here I don't think there's anything I
can do
word I don't think there's anything I
can do
here I don't think there's anything I
can do here
right I don't think there's anything to
do here right the Lev doesn't seem very
accessible in my
opinion there's a bug that allows you to
make level this text a bug I'm not some
bug I'm not some bug exploiter you think
I would exploit bugs in video
game that's not a bug
oh it's not a bug okay wait but let me
let me think about this how am I
supposed to get level out of
here I'm assuming like there's like
this this un
intended let's
see
okay okay well
you can't get push out of
there oh my God God uh what can we make
even okay everything we can make there's
not a lot so I think we can list them
down rock is
water Rock
water and water
sink
water
is
level might be sink be related to sink
sink is more important than I thought
water is
sink rock is sink
Rock oh
gosh let's go back to Rocket push first
word even if I
can the rock is sink but I'm not sure
what rocket sink is supposed to
do rocket push and sink we have an
and we can't do
that rock and water is sink and then
rock is
push we can't do that there's no space
there's no difference between doing
water sink and and rock and water sink
cuz we're not using water
um
rock
is Rock
water
is rock is push and level doesn't
matter Rock
is m
I generally don't get it I don't I I
don't I don't see any light you know how
you normally see like a light at the end
of the tunnel I don't see anything it's
just all
Darkness I am
enveloped in darkness by Darkness
I am the storm that is
um I'm a zit
man I check all the levels to see if
there's anything else with
level but since my chat said um you're
good then
I I trust
them that I trust that I already have
everything I need and the only thing I'm
missing is a little bit of intelligence
you
think I think
so oh not these fanade
levels yeah I I trust all right I
trust I
trust I I super trust I totally trust
mea
trust this was your first
mistake I think I'm
fine also I don't think there's anything
uh to do I think this is
it or something like
that why did I do that why I press space
bar hav't tried turnning rock into water
dude what's the
point what's the point we already have
water the thing is you can't take we
can't take any of the words along the
corner along the along the edges because
there's no way to push it out so
technically the only thing we can
actually push is rock is and and we can
push water sink left to right and right
to
left water is
sink okay
no we have already done Rock his level
and water is level we're trying to dust
his
level um if you see a pink borderer
around the things it means it's a level
and it's already
done let's see
I feel like sometimes chat lacks a
critical information so when I read it
it's just people tell me a new things
I've already
tried that's also why I
ignored why I ignored reading chat in um
T 100

hello kill me welcome to the membership
please don't kill yourself thank you
please enjoy your
stay uh it's I'm I'm tunneling oh yeah
what's
new you know I literally had a tunnel
emote before I had
like I remember that there was a there
was a tunnel
emote when I was playing Baba in my past
life I had a I had a whole tunnel emote
just for me just for this
game I bring that back it's so
funny what did it look like it was a
literal just tunnel it's just a picture
of a tunnel I just I just drew a tunnel
I just it's just literally just a
picture of a tunnel
I might be missing a detail there's a
freaking
detail it was a picture of a tunnel oh
yeah that hole works pretty
good yeah that that hole might be it
man am I missing something I'm going to
be missing something
because I generally don't see I don't
see
it I don't see
it I thinking more
vertical try thinking more
vertical what
Doan
what I looked up the solution VOD
Watcher skip 20
hours no man no man no way
man no way man no
way
way way shouldn't be that long man way
man what what the heck is wrong with you
guys VOD Watchers give to reincarnation
in in another life no no man come
on come on come on come on come on come
on will you stream until you get it yes
I'll get the I'll get the dust levels
and then I'll oh
stop I would solve dust levels
probably
um what am I what am I
missing what am I
missing what is the something that I am
missing what is the something
a
boyfriend yeah and I'm
dead do you need DUS this level can't
you do DUS this something and then
something is
level like dust is rock and then rock is
level no because then the the the dust
would then it would be rocks being the
level it wouldn't it wouldn't be dust
this level
anymore it would just be it would just
be rocks as level right I mean I can try
are you serious that's so
stupid are you actually serious right
now cuz that would be really really
dumb because you're trying trying to do
dust's level not not not rock his level
we've already done Rock his level
put the rock
on yeah no yeah no like I I get how to I
have to move the rock over
here first I
think
uh different rocks then it wouldn't be
dust's level anymore then that would
just be rocks is
level the level is assigned to the
position on the
map what
no way dude cuz then if I did
level that would still end up being six
so that doesn't make any
sense levels are tied to objects
well that's well well well that's well
that's just
ridiculous
and
rock do this
Rock why the heck did I
this
rock oh bro can I even I need to do rock
his water
first I need to sink I need to sink out
the is to get the thing out
is it do I have to do
that hi Jer hi CH
hi I completely did not think that I I
was too focused on getting dust is level
and not dust is rock and rock is level
because rock is literally not level that
wouldn't be dust this level
anymore it's not not freaking dust
anymore man that's so stupid
man I split this
but then that would
be Rock would be stuck up
there
um so
this
hold on I'm I'm getting a brain fart
while I'm
here where do I where do I where do I do
this where do I do this
I got to do dust is
rock and then I need to get the rock
out but how do I get the rock
out if I
do rock I don't have the is to make rock
his level
what am I
doing oh dude there's an end okay
completely forgot about the
end completely forgot and
existed
what what was it going to do again dust
is
stop do do does this does this
rock dust wait what
dust and dust is
Rock oh then Rock and level is level
wait but how do I do water is
sink how I do how do I do how do I do a
rock is
water but but how do I but then but then
wouldn't it sink immediately when I put
the is in
there it'll trigger
first what is that
true what the heck it
does and
then Rock and oh my God I forgot about
this and man I was like there's no way
you're sinking the is cuz then you can't
make rock his
level
a a
right huh
I oh we got to do a winner what the
what flag
right win no no
no
what no flag is defeat flag is defeat
look at the bottom left flag is
right let me make this game screen a
little bit bigger the game
Baba slag right
dude Jen you had it no man I didn't have
it
what wait so these weren't levels only
the what what what what then that's not
a dust level then
what the heck bro what wait what what
what is
this what is this
dot it's based on the object not the
type there's no way I could have know oh
rock is
push water sink do these things sink
okay they do
rock
is what the heck is this supposed to do
oh I
see I see
I had it oh wait
what oh right I just had to push it up
was it enough 1 2 3 4 5 oh six oh bro
okay I thought I had to duplicate I
thought I had to duplicate the number of
pushes I
got my brain's a bit cooked today
I was like there's no way this level can
be that simple
man it's just like one one thing it's
just one
thing oh now surely this is also just as
simple right
bird is stop and shut flag is wind water
is
sink it's simple every time all these
right levels are
simple fruit I've never seen fruit
3 4 5 six fruit is open but fruit does
not
push first open but first not push so
we'll just
do uh push over here
bir is
stop then how do you open this
wa but now the bird doesn't go
through h
fruit is
push fruit is
open we rock is open instead of fruit is
open we rock is open it's up open how
Joy this fall but it's 4:30 a.m. let's
go yay good morning rise and
shine Sun's up in the morning
this means we need both
right H that's a bit tricky maybe we
have to finish writing everything we
need to write
here let me
think right huh
fruit is push no fruit is
push fruit is
p thank you golden
is
is Rock right Rock laau
no Rock right Rock and then we can kill
one rock and get the other Rock but what
is the
finish
Rock now we can do uh Ras push and Ras
open
can you do can you do something write
something of course you
can be
silly absolutely
silly but now I don't have enough things
to do though so maybe we actually do
have maybe we actually did have to use
fruit cuz now there's two fruits up
there that are not being used
fruit is push we couldn't have done
fruit is open maybe we could have done
wait what if it's just rock
is
oh with the bird doesn't that mean it
has to be both push and
open is there another way
is there another way for us
oh God this push mechanic is
crazy this push mechanic is
insane I think we have to use fruit I
think that fruit thing is pretty
useful I think this is right though oh
God uh
Rock right
open is it Rock right open and then we
use whatever it's is written to close it
Rock got to be something
else
Rock
right we have to
have I see I get it just
realized I am now a
where doesn't freaking matter what it
rides dude literally doesn't matter what
it
rides I had it I had it I had it um I
had it I had it I had it I had it I had
it I had it
wait wait I had it I had it I had
it
aheed I had
it I had it I had it
I have to stack two
words we have to stack two words fruit
has to be
pushed and
open fruit has to be push on
open so what do I have to write oh my
god dude what do I have to
write I have to
write rock into
push after pushing open on it
okay my bigest
life oh but then I don't have enough
stuff
to do I
I can get it out
right I just get these out
how but how but how
how do I have to do one of it
do both do two do
two so maybe not I don't have I can't do
push and open that soon
wait but how is this
possible cuz if we stack two
words 1 2 3 four 5 6 7even if we stack
two
words then we won't be able to finish it
right turns it into
text so
you can't stack two
words right we have a thing here we have
to kill one 1 2 3 4 5 6 seven
eight eight
no just going to kill a
rock can't stack to words you can't
stack to words can't to
but this is really
bad fruit is rock is
push fruit is
Rock but then we wouldn't be able to
have both of it that's really weird
ah does this
work let's this
work
wait turn the no wait no wait no doesn't
work cuz bird is stop if bird is stop is
it a 100% thing that something has to be
pushed and open to open the
bird it's got to have both properties
right push and push and open at the same
time
okay this right
thing I already did the right
thing this right is it is right even he
do fruit is right no no way you
can't
um you can't do push right you can't do
rock you can't do rock right cuz rock is
no more
right so right is a dead dead thing but
now we have a fruit maybe fruit is
Rock so we can turn the fruit back into
a rock what is the point why would they
give us a fruit just for it to be turned
into a rock
is that what the dev wanted us to
do is that why he gave us a noun as
special as
fruit did they want it to did they want
us to turn the the fruit into a rock or
did they want us to do the fruit as a
completely different thing
1 2 3 4 5 6 7even there's seven here we
can't stack
there are seven things here we cannot
stack
anything what do you mean that means you
can't stack push onto open to only
utilize rock is push and open at the
same time to get past the
bird which means that the
bird something has to be pushed and okay
wait that's the thing right if something
is push and it has to look like
this we only have two available
things we only have two available blocks
to push into the water to sink it
because
there's
oh okay
is
first to me it wasn't to right push
maybe it suppos to
write something else I I still don't
know what's what the difference
is this writing this writing the other
thing
I don't know why should I have kept the
no now but now I have too many things I
want I
need what are we abandoning and are we
supposed to replace what we abandon
Fus Fus is
push are we really supposed to turn
fruit into rock are we really supposed
to turn fruit into rock I don't I don't
know I don't like that feel bad just
having fruit exist and just turning into
a Rock when it could have done something
else we don't have to write
yet we can't stack anything stacking is
illegal
we have to feed the bird with fruit okay
so it's got to be fruit right cuz then
they wouldn't do something as silly as
this they wouldn't give us a fruit and a
bird and expect us to not feed the bird
with the
fruit why
up so there's no way fruits fruit is
there to turn into a
rock there is no way I mean you can kill
a bird with a stone but I think that's a
bit cruel
you know why would you do that but that
might be that might be what the what the
what the dev thought about like they're
like they're like yeah I'm sure the
gamers are going to expect the fruit to
be fed to the bird so it goes away but
in reality you're supposed to kill a
bird with the
rock I mean two of these things are both
effective ways to get rid of birds
right
aha I get it
okay what the heck do this accomplished
now we don't have
worse can we split this all right I
guess we can't split this
God dang
it Fus push an open
can even Rock right
is two different
things right missing one tile right
no we're missing one
tile 1 2 3 4 five six we have six we're
trying we're currently trying to s
seven water sinks
both uh push and open
right rock is

Ro right
what's another funny thing we can do
there's nothing no funny thing fruit
is hold
on I know what the heck this is going to
do probably nothing
fruit is push you have to do fruit is
push down
open is there a way to
like there's no way is there no way is
there nothing to
do how
to spawn something to spawn
something to spawn a
fruit because I think open
only consumes one
thing unlike sink which consumes
two
so nah dude what am I saying
man there's no there's no way to spawn
another fruit with two pro with the
properties open and
move oh my God
see to spy
to spawn two letters in a
time you spawn two things at a
time I see I'm now
