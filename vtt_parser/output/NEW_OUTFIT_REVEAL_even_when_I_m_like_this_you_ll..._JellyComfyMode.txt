a side chain is I'm genuinely interested
than we 10 tip
blank why would you want to know what a
side chain is it's nothing it's not that
hard it's just dipping the vocal track
or like the top the Top Line when when
there's like a drum kick or like a a
kick or like a snare yeah
anyways thank you you for the 20 thank
you for the 20 members thank you Mr
Johnson thank you everybody welcome
please enjoy your state please enjoy
your
state thank you
Jinky thank you love out thank
you oh you don't know what any of that
meant okay so like there's a kick right
so when there's a kick usually the sound
the the the volume of the song goes like
goes like up a little bit and when the
kick is like in in in front of like
everything it like makes it sound
garbage so when when there's a kick that
does that you usually dip the rest of
the song to make the kick to make space
for the kick um sound the kick
waveform yeah so if you do that
something like that I guess when you do
that you
make the song sound better and it gives
it the um little like what the heck am I
saying I don't I I I'll show you next
