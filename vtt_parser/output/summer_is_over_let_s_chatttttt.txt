okay anyways what the heck is a summer
camp anyways like the only exposure I've
ever I've ever
had um with uh what a summer camp is is
um that that that horror game the Cory
the one with the with the Among Us it's
not really Among Us the one with the
werewolves you know sounds like some
cult preaching okay we got to stop cuz
we're getting too close it's it's this
game called The Quarry man like hacket
Quarry it's a it's about it's about this
group of friends who went to summer camp
like this group of like summer summer
counselors or something and then they
went to like the summer camp and then
some stuff happened
it's really weird you play video games
that's barely a video game that's like a
movie yeah it was a really funny one I
think I think it was absolutely
hilarious that was a really funny
game yeah that's the only exposure I've
ever had to summer camp have you guys
ever been to actual like living
breathing summer
camp
yeah have you guys ever actually been to
real living breathing summer camps no
yeah once how was it tell me about it
you went to summer camp as a kid where
you're like have you ever been like
counselors at a summer
camp I was kind of mid to Drama
Island it was kind of cringe what did
you guys
do you're a counselor for 10 years oh my
God it almost it's like an theer
American thing I think yeah I've only
ever been to like a sleepover at
school I almost drowned during a swim
test we had to do like some team
building
garbage God I hated it man we had to
build like a raft in the middle of like
the the woods dude we had to build like
a oh my God it was so stupid it was like
in the middle of the Jungle and we had
to build like a raft and there was like
this monkey bar thing and we had to
climb that
too you eat play outside do crafts maybe
watch a movie Saturday night what the
heck do you guys even do in summer camp
is that it do guys like tell scary
stories by the campfire and roast
marshmallows while you're doing
it you must survive in the woods for one
night that was like really close there
were like wild dogs and everything
around
us there were like wild dogs and
everything and like there were like a
bunch of bugs in like the
dorms tried to pick up girls that's
insane so was just a socialization
thing a field trips oh thank you Ern
fory welcome back I Was A Boy Scout we
did summer camp it's fun
oh boy scouts I didn't I didn't know Boy
Scouts existed I thought Only Girl
Scouts existed make this bigger oops
let move this up here
okay two weeks of a living hell out Bush
aren't wild dogs really dangerous yeah
we just fed it like the rice that we
cooked so that it would
leave and then more would come back they
would like come with their wife and kids
and then there would be like I I think I
have like I think we had like um
how many dogs were there there were like
I remember like clearly on like some
concrete floor there were like seven
dogs just lying
there it's insane you fed a dog so it
believe no I fed a dog so it wouldn't
eat
me you know oh no the
JB
okay oh no man I was really young I was
really young I was really young do you
bark at them no I didn't I didn't want
to go close yeah and we had to like
shower from like pills and buckets at
least there was like an enclosed room so
like we didn't have to shower in the
middle of the woods cuz that that would
that would not be
great but yeah I don't remember how we
got around do we walk yeah we walked oh
my god dude it was like a
hill and like we had to like oh God it
was awful okay I don't want to talk
about this is this it was it was
horrible it was absolutely awful it was
terrible but like climb climb rocks and
get to like a site to like build the
raft and G and stuff like
that yeah never been a summer camp but
I've been camping and it's fun to hike
dig holes and shoot I want to shoot I
want to shoot I want to kill a deer I
think that' be really
cool I think that really cool I'm going
to trauma dump why did you go to that
camp it's mandatory for us to pass the
class if we didn't go we couldn't pass
our class so we had to go it was like my
only the only time I had I ever went to
like some form of Camp because I would
always skip
them what did y ever do to you oh no not
Yuri yri is a pretty deer I'm going to
kill an ugly
deer and it fores to touch
grass man they forc us to touch grass
they forced us to touch grass and then
they made us write a report about what
we learned it was awful it sucked I
didn't have
fun how many students survive this Camp
I they were werewolves and
everything how CH was doing thisy thank
you this is so the first time I super do
you still have nightmares about the
grass I don't know I didn't really
interact with anybody I wasn't like an
all girls DM so it wasn't that
bad jealous archery sees in my area but
those cowardly deer don't get close to
me unfortunately I want to shoot a deer
with a bow and arrow that sounds so
cool that sounds so
cool that's so cool you know how to
interact with girls no I didn't interact
with
anybody man it was so I remember like
being all emo and stuff and going out in
the middle of the night and just like
looking at the star cars cuz I I
couldn't sleep in that in this in this
stupid stupid
dorm thank God I survived the labor I
mean summer camp how what did you guys
think about face summer camp I think a
crossbow suits you better than a bow but
it's so cool to like aim a bow don't you
think you're too small to hold a deer
gun
no
no I'll put on the ground like a sniper
rifle
do you see any shooting stars no but it
was really beautiful because I don't
it's it's like A Place With No Light
pollution you can use a bow I've I've
tried like shooting stuff before I've
tried like um I've tried holding a bow
and arrow before I think it would be
really cool I think it's really cool I
do think that if I were to pick up like
a sport of some sort I think it would be
you know the bow the bow bow it was a
recur no it was a regular
bow yeah and every time I'm finished my
arm like my like my left arm the one
holding the bow would like
be would be a noodle for the rest of
like the next two
days Sumer Camp was a blast a yay I'm
glad you had fun I'm glad you had
fun she's going to get super buff Archer
shoulders yeah and I don't want that you
know I don't want to be like overly buff

Sunset endless Sunset endless
Sunset yeah yeah I want to talk about it
I want to I want to talk about I want to
talk about um our our our our progress
are our our writing my writing if you
guys want to know of course I don't know
if you're interested if you are then I
can Yap about it let's let me let me
show you the project
file hi run a through process like from
the very beginning when when I decided
to talk about
this so like um when I first thought
about about the project we had to do two
two summer
songs and my summer song was going to be
with
um with a nine oh god what the heck is
this
layout is darts it's too big to shoot
Bears
Kuma Kuma Kuma from
T dozy said you were the monkey Queen
what what what do you mean was a monkey
Queen yeah this is the demo project file
I have like a demo for the song this is
this is it I should probably like make
this a bit less ugly it's really
ugly it's really ugly Jesus we have like
a couple of drafts of
this where all the tracks purple what
the heck I can change the color for you
it fades into blue look it fades in a
blue yeah um so basically I had to do a
demo for
everybody uh to sing and stuff um I
think I have my recordings as well in a
different project file but this is the
demo uh so basically what happened
knowing it's ugly in publishing anyways
no this is not it's just the the the
organization that's bad okay this is
just a bad it's just bad
organization the Pico rap was crazy yeah
it I I it was like a oh my God I can
show you that project follow the one I
sent P it was really cringe I don't know
if I want to say I don't know I want to
send
it oh my
God
anyways anyways anyways uh no I wasn't I
wasn't doing it in Japanese I was like
doing it
like yeah it I didn't think she would
follow it that that closely but
basically what I did was like da da da
da I did stuff like that and I was like
can you write in a section I didn't
think she would like actually like
follow the exact
like the exact um Rhythm for it and even
the intonation of
it oh my God okay so basically let me
just run through it from run run you
through the process from the very
beginning so for the very
beginning I think s's going to kill me
if she knows that I if if if she knew I
uh if I if if she if she if if she if if
if she where where are the files if if
she knew
I sent if I showed all the whips of
this she doesn't have to know we have
summer eight and we have summer nine and
we have summer seven
look these are all these are some whips
I think there's like earlier ones but
basically
um I wanted to do something
like Katy Perry's
fireworks it was like a Katy Perry song
I was like can you C copy like this Katy
Perry song cuz I think it would work
really well for
summer like the first draft like the the
court progression was kind of off so
like hey can you like copy this Katy
Perry song
instead cuz I cuz I thought it would be
really suitable for like a summer song
you know and she was like okay yeah laow
got
it and and yeah yeah I thought it turned
out pretty well like let me let me show
you some of the
stuff here I think this was the first
one this is all
similar this basically the same I
think yeah this is basically the same
it's I mean I just said use Katy Perry
as an inspiration you
progression um first I had a little bit
of trouble like writing the chorus I
have I have like a very early draft of
um what I wrote for the chorus it was
basically like demo
a but yeah um this time when I wrote the
song uh when when we wrote the song I
started with the title of the song I I
really wanted it to be um endless Sunset
and like the the whole the whole um
theme of the song I had like a little
little blur for it I was it was
something like
uh
um what what was it again what was it
again what was it again what was it
again let me look in my
DMs endless
Sunset yeah um me
see yeah it was
like yeah if this is the last Sunset
then that will'll ever have together
then I'm praying that it'll never end
that was like the first that was like
the first basic basic blurb of what I
want the song to feel like
mhm it's like yeah it's like wanting to
be with your friends forever how sappy
yeah I mean I mean when you write songs
you got to make it sappy okay morbid she
named an endless D that's a horrible
name yeah so anyways the first drap was
like this it was
like as a day fad away we're together
like this there's a feeling in the back
of my mind let me let me look for it
actually it was the first draft and I
didn't really like it so I rewrote it to
I rewrote the entire
course I think during this part during
like this entire writing section we were
actually pretty pretty good on time like
uh we worked on this really early but
then the crunch got really bad near the
end cuz deadlines were being missed and
like people are getting sick and
everything so we couldn't really get
anything in on
time okay let me where is it where did I
where did I put this where did I put
this face
connect
aha um
endless sumwhere
the yeah you know don't pretend you this
was 10
yeah that that was the tar ra and then
here's the early Top Line draft I
think don't laugh don't laugh don't
laugh at
me whatever whatever okay whatever okay
whatever whatever
no this was the first round I think like
the first ever draft I think the first
verse was really good so I didn't really
change
it uh I think it starts
here shaking me to the car if I fall
into the sand I want to play together
every day the time we have is way too
short to get it
take my head I got a feeling that we're
going to slow down cuz I want to
together always face can't end this
way catch the ball in your hands my way
ofing I
love this was the first draft this
there's a feeling in the back of my
mind I day every day has been nothing
but place so I don't want it to end
this so listen to me baby let make never
so
Unforgettable is part all again if this
is the last Dan that we'll have together
here and oh I and never ever end
why is it not like mixed man why is it
like just
raw and this is like a copy paste cuz I
was cuz I wanted to like get the um
structure
right catch the ball in your hands my
way of staying I love
so yeah that's that's it that's that's
basically it and then I and then I had
like this little epiphan I was like
having this like whole like meltdown I
was like oh my god dude this chor sucks
it's not catchy it's like it doesn't
flow properly like it doesn't there's no
like upbeat and there's like it's like
it's like cooked and I was like I think
I can probably do better and then like
as I wrote the current one I was like
but I like the second part of the first
chorus more but I was like oh but I want
to give everybody like some lines that's
not just that's not just like the um
that's not just their solo lines and um
so I was like what if we had like this
this little section when everybody is
like going like uh everybody's saying
their own lines and like since there's
like nine people right we can do like
one one one one one and then two people
will share one one bar and then that'll
be nine um versus it it was the same it
was the same feeling it was the same
thing I I I shared when I um we were
apping the structure of the song we were
like this this person one bar one bar
one bar one bar so that's four bars
before each chor uh four sections before
each chorus and then another four
sections before the chorus and then one
bridge to fill in that nin person for
that ninth person one Bridge before the
um final course and stuff that they Shar
versus yeah yeah let me show you
actually thank you n for the super thank
for the well
welcome did you play the guitar in the
recording no it was a it's it's a
plugin I remember I remember um I

crippled okay there we go I was like why
is it so
loud make some M baby take some pigs by
the barbecue maybe getting a little
hungry
yeah I had to give muu that line the
rest of the lines I think they picked
some of
them and then this is I think this is
Pico's um line I just put it in
there she's so
cute don't pret don't you want to be
closer you're one and only mama don't be
shy I'm here I want to stay like this
looking up to the seing tell you matter

things about the actual produced version
of this song that I really like
too Mee suddenly now I just want to sing
and shout all about how fun it is with
you with this sun that I'll never
forget I I for a cup of
coffee cholate cooky what are you
doing I'm enjoying your compy off
back feel Cat
come I really like this part I really
like this um this this this this
breakdown I think I think this breakdown
is I think this breakdown is really cool
I like
it I like it thank you py and the stars
come up at night I don't want to close
my eyes cuz I'd rather stay up by your
side
I haven't listened to this in a
while why is it in my left ear yeah
anyways I think the last course I think
Amy really killed it in the last course
it was like crazy like the belt she did
was insane I could not
yeah this was the demo I sent them
basically yeah that that was a demo
that's that's the entire demo um
basically what I did was I wrote this
part first I think I had a good idea for
the for the first versus
um a pretty fast part for the pre pre
chorus I think I think this was
basically set in stone the moment I
wrote it and for the chorus I was kind
of debating but after like um for for
this part it could have been uh could
have been different you know like it
could have been
like I could have not had this and I
could have had the first version instead
which was how did it go again uh uh how
did it go again I have the lyrics here
oh like this there's a feeling in the
back of my
mind I want to say every day has been
nothing but bliss but I don't want to
end this
time yeah but it doesn't flow very well
right you would think it would think the
next part it goes like like listen to me
baby let's make me
so
Unforgettable us about it all again I I
think that's a good like Melody but I
don't know where to fit it you know I I
think no it doesn't really flow I don't
think you know I think I think the
second verse was I think the second
verse had a pretty good like Melody
going but like it it went like it had a
good Rhythm and it had like uh not not
not like a melody that's not jump
doesn't jump too much so it could have
had the potential to be catchy but what
do I know
I think this the I think this the best I
could have done yeah I think having this
cute part was very important I
think yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
thank
you yeah and oh my God let me play this
so when's the jelly solo MV coming out I
was thinking of doing solo covers of the
songs that I wrote like um forgot the
names write the future
I've think I've been thinking of doing
those but I've never really gotten
around to it um anyways wait I want to
show you the the actual like version Let
me let me just open this on
YouTube what Amy Leon meiru meu's not
here what are you talking about
oh after ex carefully examining
everything clearly they have something
that the rest of you don't I mean the
chest Department um we separated it
based on like
um we separated it based on basically
like like basically like Vibes you know
like like pico would sing a cute song
like a pop upbeat song um Amy would also
sing also has like a more upbeat vibe to
her like to like her
character and like
huh Hina what happened
there I don't remember actually but that
was I'm not I don't really remember I
should to
remember did I miss something I think I
missed something Leah was padding no
Leah was cute Leah's
cute no Pico's basically like this part
like the part the breakdown part here
like this part was always going to be a
rap part it was um I think every I think
I wrote a lot of the lines without
really thinking about who to assign them
to cuz I don't really want to assign
people to stuff cuz maybe they don't
like that part especially like around
this part the the
basically the only things I've assigned
is tma's rap and Pico's rap and
then cuz I think having like a Japanese
section flow in in the middle it would
be really cool
um uh this part what the heck is going
on outside I hear I hear I I hear I hear
an
ambulance do you hear
that I hear an
ambulance anyways the only Parts I
assigned I had people in mind when I
wrote this but I didn't really assign
them I didn't assign any of these parts
these first three I assigned this one to
myself because of the ball I when I saw
the art I I don't know why but I
misremembered it and I was like oh yeah
Remy is holding the ball right so I I
actually wrote this for Remy but then I
but then I checked the art again and it
was actually me holding the ball so I
just gave Remy the second
section is in my
head there's an ambulance going on
there's an ambulance
outside um I I did I did these two parts
for Pico and
Tenma I I gave the hungry one to Moo to
Moo
you a little hungry moo it was actually
supposed to be me but I thought muu
being hungry would be really
cute um I think the bikini l was always
going to be hena's or Amy's it was one
of
it
else enough let's make some baby take
some P by the barbecue maybe getting a
little hungry water's a little too cold
for me it's a it'sit too tight in this
bikini could you help me with my sun
I guess the only lines that are hard to
sign were the PCO lines cuz I don't
really write well in Japanese like my
grammar is kind of kind of bingus you
know the the ooh barbecue line like the
one the one on my summer summer
promo I had like a really I I drew like
a little section for everybody as well
when I like wrote the lines for based on
the second part the verse then you came
five months assigning lines based on the
art is
crazy I didn't I didn't assign that I
didn't assign that much I basically had
like some roles in in in mind like um we
have like somebody who's scared of the
water we have somebody who's um playful
somebody who's like who who has a tight
bik and stuff you know
no I did not get my
jarue I think I had a lot of trouble
riding the second
sectionate what are you
doing I'm enjoy
your like this catch a cold line was
going to be the same person as the uh as
the person who sang the um the this a
cold the water is a little too cold for
me it was always going to be the same
person
um I feel like getting the get in the
water dummy is something that muu would
100%
say
yeah what else I was going to talk about
something but I forgot oops oh yeah I
drew something
yeah where was it let me look let me
look it
up I'm really happy with how the song
Turned out in general I think it's
cool that could also be a Leah thing
could
yeah wait where's where's
vocal where is
it oh I drew this in paint
here
is let me just name it something stupid
okay uh this was based on this line I
drew it for everybody like you know to
maybe hopefully encourage them to record
their lines or
something yeah it was it was based on
this for a of
cocolate cookies hey what are you doing
water I'm enjoying your
compy
back feel catch come on now let's take
it
slow
yeah yeah was the beat being used in the
promos planned
oh no but it was it was pretty easy to
get I guess it's that's why I didn't
produce the song I just wrote everything
for it and um
except for the Pico rap part and uh yeah
um actually Mee also did a lot in
helping me like arrange the vocals and
arrange the harmonies I think the
harmonies added a lot to the song Let me
just let me just play let me just play
it on uh
freaking unfreaking
YouTube is that
love 3 2 1 let go waves breaking on the
Shing like you hear the you hear this
like like you hear that wait waves waves
breaking on the shore shore shaking me
to the core and I fall into the sand
like the harmonies there and the Echo
and the waves and the and the whatever
and the shore like that was genius I
think H that was genius
get it all take my hand I got a feeling
that we're going too fast I want to slow
down cuz I want to last together always
smile on my face summer this
way the in your hands is my way of
saying I love you so won't you say
it the day Fades away the
sun wa this this section okay uh let's
skip the course
like the like the doubling in this is is
pretty good
good so hard to say
summer without
say so I can
say
the and okay okay whatever over here
over
here what are you doing
here I want to talk about this last
course cuz I actually had an aneurism
when I heard
this like can you hear that in the
background that's that's Amy right the
one that goes
like
like yeah
that's Amy right like the belt was crazy
that went so hard I died when I heard it
I was like it's insane there's no way
that's
crazy God I I don't know I'm just so
obsessed with that with that single
line I'm so obsessed to the SE so
beautiful but in my eyes I can see
this way I can say here is where I want
to
be God what the heck man oh God I'm G to
die oh God that was I I don't know
hearing that makes me tear up it's so
good oh God anyways yeah I think that's
about it for the song I don't have
anything else to talk about anymore what
else should I talk
about anyways
wait I can just check I can just check
the the script and I can I can I can I
can uh narrow down who it is is got to
be Amy right am I unless I'm
deaf yeah it's it's definitely Amy it is
Amy
God God
man
yeah talk about seafoam I didn't do
anything for seafoam I think that was
all
Vedra uh and andri of course I think um
I think the chorus for that song is
really catchy I think it's a has a
really good chorus
too what can you say about what s
contributed the entire
production the entire
production what do you do when you were
sick I was in my bed doing being
miserable I was in my in my bed being
super miserable but you know it's eh
it's it's a what it's what I can talk
about some some more yeah I didn't know
anything for sea we had to separate um
we I I I was I was just in charge of
this one
song yeah p r

break into my heart it's a little bit
overdue but I can I can Yap about this

into a let me Yap about music stream how
overqualified are you to do
what
yeah come on you can load oh my God my
computer just beeped
twice I forgot I mixed this

oh oh God that's my
mix yeah It beeped twice and it froze

okay it seems to be stable somewhat it
doesn't seem that bad you mixed that I
mixed I mixed this yeah I mix I mix be
break into my heart beat into my heart
what am I talking
about I need now more around dude this
makes it such a disaster like like
everything is
everywhere
ah ah I've got an entire bus for people
say
it's very layered this song it's
actually really
layered
am Holy is there anything I can do to
make this
less oh my
God uh if I turn off D noise I think
it'll be
fine I think D noising is probably the
worst
thing uh where do I where do I bust this
to
vocal oh yeah it's way better now okay
I'm Jesus
TR here I think I think um I don't talk
too much about the backing vocal for
baby
break break deep into my heart
I think I think um one of the biggest
issues I had with this I also have oh my
God I also have like early versions of
the song Wait I also have early versions
of the song wait I'm going to show
you um basically I I I had a lot of
trouble mixing the chorus cuz like I
feel like the uh uh uh uh didn't really
hit hard enough so I had like four
layers for it for some reason oh wait
wait I have I have like some I have an
early Chorus for this I have an early
Chorus for this where is
it where do I save
this break into my heart oh
here
oh wait date
modified where
does he play the song on her radio show
tonight
awesome what percentage of songw writing
is you um I think um this song was a
uh it was like it was actually first
made by um kagura and I sent it to sto
to basically like buff it up cuz kagura
wasn't free to work on it more and I had
more like aspirations for it so I was
basically like like going like Okay so
this part can you like make it like you
know more like something and then this
part you got to make it more like
something and then she was like
okay but um I wanted to make this song
More me so that's why like I mixed it
and stuff
mhm uh where is it where where did I oh
yeah I also wrote the lead I also wrote
the lead I also have the lead that I
wrote where is it the
lead um she she buffed up on my lead a
bit so it's it's a lot better
but I really wanted this one I really
wanted this U melody in
yeah but the but the new one sounds like
this but this is the this is the second
chorus one this
one I think she copied my sound exactly
which is insane like I like that little
sound uh but basically let me see secret
behind the drawer un scen Conta yeah
this is the secret stream this is the
secret
stream the
secrets where is the where are the rest
of the songs where's the where are the
rest of
this V isolated basically like this when
did I do this
802 why do I have two flps are named
exactly the same thing oh one is
breaking to my jart cuz I I spell I I I
typ j instead of H
for oh my god
um and this was in this is before the
drawer by the way this was
like it like the fifth it like the
fifth is it this one is it this wrong is
it this is it this Whip please load oh
my God
oh this is the first whip is this the
first
whip like it's all
Canon this is the first whip I
think this was this is what the song
sound like but this is what the song
sounded like before sing
to by my side never really came around
think about being with the cuz of got
too much on my mind people say I'll
never find somebody stay this way this
who I
am change thisen heart
of I want to
try no way this is the first
draft baby
no way this is the first draft I had
another draft I need to like look look
at the in my DMs for
this what what what I what I name the
song is it basically like this what's
this what is basically like this what is
this
song oh this is the first structure
final
oh okay okay uh wait then wa where is
the first where's the first draft am I
blind and
deaf am I blind and deaf break into my J
no can you answer the very important
question of what's the can you're
opening the can opening um sfx is
like it's like the most common kind of
like transition sound in like
EDM I think that the can open was in the
first uh in the
first in the first draft so like I think
sto just kept it is like a Coke yeah
it's like a Coke whatever it's a Coke
yeah sure it's a
Coke J Loki calls you Professor jelly
what do you think about that I'm really
shy I mean they're all really awesome I
think they're all they're all Prof
professors to me as well
yeah it's it's it's it's it it it it it
makes me pretty
shy I'm just look on everything and
maybe I can find uh the first
modified
here this is
I had a couple of I had a couple of
drafts this was
530 where is it Professor jelly sounds
like an energy jelly
brand that sounds pretty good I would I
would I would I would eat that Professor
can I use a toilet no you should have
gone to the toilet before the lecture
started don't you have an active
teaching job to be Prof I think they're
all like you know I respect them and I
look up to them so I think I can learn a
lot I can learn a lot from them
so yeah something like that has three
grams of caffeine
awesome where is it I can't find it I
can't find it I think I deleted all my
girs let me let me try opening this
um yeah
sure save did your empty your recycle
bin
probably
dude this is
sold this is
actually I think the project crashed
that's why I have two different versions
select can I select everything that
hasn't that isn't in the
playlist what are
these oh my God what what what are what
are these what are these what are these
vocal files what are these
God oh my God it's so bad I don't want
to show you it
anymore it's so bad it's so bad it's so
bad oh my God it's so bad it's so bad
it's so bad it's so bad it's so bad it's
so bad it's so bad it's so bad it's so
bad it's so bad it's so bad it's so bad

it's so
bad oh God oh my God I'm so
self-conscious
now what did it what was
dude oh my God oh my God are these all
of it no this is the first one
oh my
God it was like
uh it was it was the same like kind of
it was the same kind
of I I don't I can't I can't put it
together anymore I remember I remember
what it see what it sounded
like te me how to feel how to feel how
to feel what you call
love dude it was so bad dude it was so
low dude it was like it it it didn't
have like the the the the the the the
I'm like waving my hands like you can
see me the the the like the up and down
motion you
know yeah it it went like
um mmy would you teach me how to feel
how to feel how to feel you
call I don't
know yeah the new one was definitely
better this one was like hot garbage it
was hot garbage hot garbage hot garbage
hot
hot I think it was not that bad should
write the future project file next okay
yeah sure it's going to crash my
computer but I'll
try yeah it was okay I enjoy the energy
of the new one me too I think the new
one's got the catchy Vibe I wanted to
I've always wanted to
write yeah you're you're getting
exclusive listens of scrapped drafts
never to be heard ever
again anyways I was talking about this
right
look at my
layers nobody hears this nobody hears
this
nobody hears
this nobody hears that not many people
hear this but nobody hears that low
nobody hears this but if I don't have it
it sounds bad
why is it only in the left
ear I think I got too lazy to do to
record the right ear
version than you for the 14 months nice
forehead thank
way nobody hears that nobody hears this
either nobody hears this
either what program you use I use FL to
mix and I use uh here are my
plugins here are my plugins I have all
of these oh it's not it's not I just
realized it's not been tracking my my
mouse oh my God start tracking my
mouse I've got all of these all of these
yeah I don't hear those yeah I didn't
like it I didn't like it if it stood out
like if it stands
out this one this one is this one
doesn't is this one pretty it's it's not
that inaudible this one is
inaudible it's kind of there but it's
not like if I made it
louder it kind of clashes so it just
made it really soft I'm not I've never
been very good at ad
living now if Amy was here that' be a
different
story I like this part
I think some of the layered bits get
lost to compression from being uploaded
to YouTube and other streaming sites
yeah that makes sense I mean whatever I
listen to most music in my car so it's
not I going to hear a lot
anyways let me open right the
future
open do I even have it do I even have it

surely right this actually a good
response thank you I don't prepare for
this young man so implies you're old no
you can call I can call you young even
if I'm young
myself could I use it to remove vocals

music to create my own

ethical of you young

stay
forever this way and never let
go let us meet again time and place
tomorrow our time together will never
end a brand new page
your the
memories me it's all I want to do want
to ride the future with
you oh CU violin part I put a lot of
effects on
that what what what do I have to say
about this it's been a while so I don't
really remember anymore let me just look
at each look at each
layer I don't I I do take criticism
because I don't play the piano
this is a rose I
think should have may made that like one
octave
lower got some uh layering here I do not
play the piano I do not I do not I have
some I have some I spammed like wind
chimes here cuz I thought it would be
funny it's like 50 million different
wind chimes cuz it it it needed
something but I didn't know what it
needed so I just dumped buch of wi
Chimes also I I didn't have like a ton
of time to work on
this but I think it's all right I like I
like crunched like a seconding amount of
time hi jelly did you use uh whoa I'm
not saying that
part I feel like I I wanted like a very
particular guitar sound but I couldn't
really find it also this is without any
um EQ cuz I I had to use the suoth to EQ
to make this not sound like garbage but
uh too
bad almost got her no there was no way
it was in no way almost it was it was
not even close baby it was it was not
even close baby
I I guess I like the melody for this
song I I really quite liked
violin I was like harmonizing with it a
little bit
okay but the real question is where is
the jacked AR I think it was this one no
this is like this is like Jack
guitar it was this one I
think this has to be the Jack yeah this
is the jack darp why is it called why is
it name the
jackar should have used the melody for
the radioactive band thank you oh for 10
months why is this called the jacked
ARP why is this called the Jack why is
this why is this called
nah what why is this called
N I know what it's called called nah it
kind of
sucks it's kind of be like kind of like
a swell if you know what I mean
nah yeah the violence are just layering
I really don't like how they
sound I like two different V layers of
my insane
oh yeah was cuz Sak kept going like we
need more strings we need to sound like
the song and then I was like okay
strings okay I don't have very good
string libraries but
okay and we have this what's
nah this is on named sad I would have
named it something
funny but yeah I think that's it I got
the wind chimes going insane again near
the
end oh God we got
the key
change
mhm man I really want to like write a
song that's not this soy this this soy
this the soy guitar violin
piano stuff you know I I wish I wish I
could write something more in the genre
I usually write in because this is not
this used to be my expertise but it's
not really anymore I've been
experimenting a lot more with other
things but man sound like Sims Music
what the
heck what the heck man
isn't this soy this is like Peak soy
dude I like wrote this and it was like
it was like oh my guys
soy this is so
soy how is it not soy it's so soy it's
so soy it's even
lagging oh my God it's so soy yeah it's
kind of like anime ending music thank
you kimchi for the seven months heavy
metal jelly went I can't I can't there's
a lot of things that I can't really
replicate perfectly like if I could play
the guitar the song would be a lot
better if I could properly play the
piano the song would be a lot better
this just sounds like I'm trying to
write something but it just sounds too
electronic you know so I had to like add
some electronic butts so it sounds like
it's meant to be like that and I just
try to like bury everything in the
vocals cuz the instrumental itself
sounds kind of
but like with the vocals I guess it's
you know less it it it focus is a lot
less in the
tear through
everything it's always been
TR so won't you
stay another day
will meet again same time and I'm not
very good at writing this kind of lyrics
I'm not very good at this I'm going to
be completely honest I like how this
sounds but I was tearing my hair out
trying to write something
like like like like I am I'm like emo at
heart man I'm emo at heart man
I'm evil at
know and I I had to write this thinking
of like 20 something people in mind and
I was like oh God how is this I I had I
actually had a different rough of this I
had a
different I had a different um draft of
this song
I had a I had an early draft hold on let
me let me sound let me show you um where
is it phase connect Gerald would you be
so kind to ask Jack Ark which routine
does it think is best for arms and core
I'm sorry I think Jack ARP is kind of
busy right now I don't know who is an
emo at heart I know some people they
they love life you know some people wake
up in the morning and they're like oh my
God I'm so happy to be alive today I'm
going to go water my flowers and take a
jog like that's not
me like people do that people do that
they're like today they they wake up in
the morning and instantly think oh my
God I'm going to go make myself
breakfast I think I'm going to have two
sausages with one with baked beans and
uh ham and bread and then after that I'm
going to go water some flowers and I'm
going to go say hi to my neighbor like
those people are
psychopaths they wake up at 6 and
they're like I'm going to make breakfast
and say hi to my neighbor who's also
watering their plant in their creepy all
full White House suburban
slower it used to be slower yeah it used
to be slower thank you silia super
welcome welcome to New Star night happy
people are evil thank you
AEL now have draft draft draft one sped
up oh my God this was the
melody this was the melody
yeah
uh but it was too high for some people
and if I were to lower it it sounds bad
so I had to sing in a different tone I
guess I guess it was like I W to see you
again another time another
day something like that something like
that there was there was something going
on there was something going on for
sure for sure for
sure uh
but yeah that was that was another
scrapped um
one yeah what is this song like
now
oops oh so let us meet again there was
there I wanted to have some sort of
overlap to have two different groups of
people singing
it did that work thank you
did um do I have draft
2
I oh
God this is like
really very bad
lyrics but um I think when I said this
draft uh they were like uh it doesn't
and it's not good for a group song I
guess could be the BG music for aot's
Paradise what is
that so let us meet again time and place
tomorrow oh this was already the proper
version am today I wouldn't have it any
other way
I want to ride
the oh my God I'm like crackling here
that's
insane yeah that was the first one of
the first
drafts and then this was the next draft
had like a lot of trouble with this
song all I hope that you can be with
please
take I wish we could stay
forever this way and never let go this

this is still one of my favorite
songs three
Euphoria yeah of course you're allowed
to of
course one of the perks I get from
writing music for face connect is that I
occasionally get to use it for
Content jelly do you have any good jokes
uh my
life
yeah I can try the one for Colo as
well uh
here please load I beg
lag it's going to lag it's going to lag
it's going to
lag it's going to lag it's going to lag
nectar 3 insert
35 why do I have nectar 3 here oh it's
cuz I tried to uh vocalize oh I think I
did vocalize for this actually AST two
okay whatever this should be good
enough oh my God please load hey guys
I'm can show you gen one as well yeah
sure I really like the funny Melody I
did for
this I think that part was insane but um
might just be me I think I spent a lot
of time on this
one this sheena's voice actually cuz I
mixed her
um girls like me don't cry cover so like
I just I just yed it for some vocal
chops
y yeah I just stole it thanks Gina I
don't really have other vocals besides
mine to work
with I don't think I'm ever making
something like this ever
again I don't think I'm ever doing
anything like this ever again I think I
really went out of my way for this one
I don't think I've ever been this
creative in my life and then I'm just uh
burnt out now
so I feel like this could could have a
little a better transition but I I don't
know I think I think it's I think it's
good enough for like a background music
you
know let me let me look at the layers
I'm
interested why did I
why is this why is this all in one track
why is this all in one
track that's 1 2 three 4 that's four
patterns in one track am I insane why
did I do
that what's wrong with that it means I
can't look at each one and and like uh
uh what is that word uh solo each
instrument like from the pattern roll
thing what are you using to edit this is
FL FL FL
Studio I do this a lot I use this a lot
I do this all the time like I I do this
delay by three and then I use this exact
instrument every single time
I also do this a
lot I isolate I isolate a word I also do
this a lot
interesting oh I did vocalize for
this then I turned I turned off the
um effect for this
bit yeah that's it I'll just mute it
because it doesn't really add much that
I care much
for yeah that's all it's for interesting
harmonies oh it wasn't it's not actually
harmonies look at this look at this look
at this crazy look at this crazy hack
look at this crazy lazy
ha where is it where is it let me where
is it where is it where is it where is
it turn it back on turn it back
on look if I just turn this off it's
actually there's actually no harmonies
and I just I'll just add this in and
suddenly it's like 10 times Fuller but I
only had to record this once it's crazy
okay I'll show you the cadio one k
cadio
cadio cadio why would you out yourself
when I thought you were being cool cuz I
don't want to lie to you about how cool
I am you
know okay trailer two trailer

Kido
Kido Kido Kido kid

jelly yeah I love everybody from
Euphoria I think they're really
awesome
Kido
kadoo
Kido col like a kidos
I muted something I think no I didn't I
think some just hasn't loaded yet but
this is a pretty light
Harps listen to my Harps I ought to make
it work but it's good
enough how much we paid for these I
don't remember was I
break into my
heart contact this my
friend does it did you play all these
instruments does it look like I play any
instruments I play the violin I don't
even record that because I don't have a
good mic for it
this is as close to artcore as I'm ever
going to
get this this this this part this part
I'm pretty sure I heard it somewhere
before can somebody tell me where they
heard this exact motive before this this
this I stole this from somewhere I stole
this from somewhere I don't remember
where it was from here I really like the
piano I did
this what genre do you usually make
music that that that that that thing
I've heard it before I've heard it
before is it is it too I remember I
remember I I stole it from my mind I
didn't like steal it steal it I didn't
like will I didn't like knowingly steal
it it's just that I know I've heard it
before and it's a good it's a good one
it's too are you
sure no I don't think it's too I think
it's something
else is it actually too no it's
something else it's got to be something
else
dude it's driving me insane it's driv me
insane it's driv me
insane oh my God I don't know but I I
like the piano I did over
here what does this even sound like
Jesus this one I also heard I've also
heard this before
it's the piano player the Chinese
restaurant I don't play the piano I
don't even know how be do
this yeah it's the same one but this one
has like the ending so
yeah I mean this it's not that hard to
like to like pretend to know how to play
piano just do this
like you know what I do for the piano
usually I would like put something
down and then I would
like I would like do this and be like Oh
yeah this is this is a good chord right
oh my god let's go and I'll be
like it I would just do that I would
just cut it and then it it would like
work somehow
I've always wanted to make
artcore I've always wanted to make
artcore
yeah yeah and that's what I do all the
time that's why my piano sounds so
bad I don't know what the heck I was on
when I did this I don't I seriously do
not know what I was
on like I don't think I could ever do
this again
oh well let's go into my
portfolio cuz I'm pretty sure like 90%
of you who like who are in the Stream
right now have not heard this in their
entire
lives what do you use a meting keyboard
for not
playing I just use it to like play a
little bit you know like some
Melodies this is like the kind of stuff
I would make well
High I've heard it in the walls
anyways I really like that what is
this what is this woodwind what the heck
is that what the heck is
this what is that this violin no wait
what what is that
brass
what what is that what is
this what is this
what the heck is that oh that's the
violin one
second one second I need to like oh not
this one that is no not this one where's
my I need to go in here and I need to go
into I need to go in here and I need to
go in a oh my God I need to go into
browse parameters and I need to I need
to change the expression of this oh my
God it wasn't working the entire
time it wasn't working the entire
time dude I hate this stinking
expression thing I got to
go oh my God it was broken the whole
time
that's why something was missing this is
what was
missing listen to my
harp listen to my
mid listen to my harp listen to my harp
listen to my harp L my heart
listen to my
Fade Out is pretty important which VST
is that
this it's probably some contact
thing it's
F it's a flute from contact Factory
Library it's clarinet from
cont
it's it's GL it's SP from contact
Factory it's a stock sound it's a stock
sound it's a stock orchestral sound it's
Stu it comes with contact it's
Stu you're right it does sound pretty
good it's stock man stock it's like the
it's like the free one they give you for
free cuz I don't I don't have anything
that I want to
buy I love stock sounds man I like use
stock sounds all the time like this
entire thing might as well be made from
stock
sounds is this stock sound okay no this
is Cinematic
one okay it's cinematic strings what
about this one ooh my double base this
is probably also cinematic
strings throw in some violent playing
from Ura oh this was also crunch time so
I couldn't ask her to like play uh play
it uh cuz cuz it would be cruel of me to
do that there's also cinematic strs Stu
this is not this is not stock this is
bot this is also probably not bot I mean
this is also probably
bought
CBR
yeah probably also cinematic C strings
actually I'm too La
check yeah
yeah yeah I like this song I think it's
I think it's actually pretty good I
think it's pretty good I had some
trouble starting it because it had to be
1 minute around one
minute I like it yeah thank you I wanted
to show this for a while now never
really found the time to but yeah this
is the stuff I've made for face connect
I can I'll show you maybe the tallenge
um bgm someday like the faas radio bgm
sheena's bgm disease star starting dis
bgm I don't think it's starting it's dis
bgm
um yeah my
own I can't be this creative ever again
no it's it's literally
machine but yeah I always think that
watching somebody make music or like
watching somebody stream how they make
music is a very ful way of learning how
uh how how to make music and how music's
made I've been curious how you made disy
intro screens since
deut deut I can show you next
time could you watch Robert
porterson yeah
anyways yeah I think how did this song
start again I know that the previous
song The Euphoria song I was given like
a a very hard reference for that and it
was actually pretty fun to like learn
how to make a song that exciting cuz
I've never made a song that exciting
before so yeah I think this one I'm a
lot more used to making orchestral stuff
because coming from an
Orchestra Orchestra or like quartet
background it's a bit easier for me to
like um think of how to do things like
this like
like this part I guess
uh this is basically the flute solo
section right and then we have like a a
call and answer part over
here this is a call from the violin and
then we have an answer from the flute so
basically how songs are structured I
think especially for orchestra things I
have been taught a lot about um this
thing called call and call Ann answer
where basically it's like a part that is
like a
question and then there's an answer from
like a different part it makes the St a
little more
interesting I always try to do that in
my music call in response whatever man
something like that yeah call and
response yeah that thing um I guess
that's one of the things I've learned
during uh my quartets my my experience
with string
instruments yeah it's a very good
feature question and answer yeah
something like that it's used a lot in
like um classical music a lot of Duets I
played with my teacher and stuff metal
does that a lot that's awesome I think
everybody does everything does that a
lot yeah I think it's I think it's a
very cool thing to to
do
yeah yeah I don't think I did any more
call and question and
answers I mean this is this is also uh
question and answer
like like this
part and then you have the brass that
ENT what whatever this is that enters a
later
I think that's the call and response for
this
section I think it's
cool yeah anyways I'm I'm pretty
obsessed with this song I think I like
it a lot yeah anyways I think we're good
for we're good with music for today
are
you are you
why am I
side anyways I I don't know I'm I'm
happy to be able to talk about my
creative process sorry if I yapped a bit
too
much I'm leaving I'm not leaving I'm not
leaving yet thank you Anam for the five
months hello J hello thank
you
than please yab more no I'm not yabing
I'm yapping
I'm not yaming that's two very different
things okay two very different things
you want to explain a new background no
this is pretty old you've seen this
before oh you haven't oh this is just my
background with the lights
on this just my this just just my
background with the lights on oh my God
I look like I have a really long neck if
I do this it looks like my neck is way
longer than it actually is
it's like that um it's like
that that that that optical illusion
where you like put your head in a box
and but where you like stick your head
out from a table and then like around
the table are mirror so it looks like
you're headless thanks for sharing your
whips I love your music ah thank you
rasco for the six months thank you thank
you thank you thank you
but if I do this then it's not actually
that long I mean now it still looks
pretty long cuz you don't know how wide
my body
is the jock Jess
monster come on oh thank you Anonymous
for the five tip when your head's like
that it looks like skibby toilet you
look like skibby toilet when you're not
even doing anything
Anonymous yum yum yum meow
meow thank you penguin for the five
months hi J see your creative process is
really cool I admire your talent and
hard work you put into these songs I do
my best to on every song that I work on
because it's going to be it's important
to me that everything I make is at least
not bad thank you thank
you thank you um Hong Kong guy by the
sua
giraffe
giraffe where's your num keys on your
keyboard I don't use num
keys I only need my f frow my fow is the
only thing I need my fow is very
important oh wait this keyboard doesn't
have an EO I'm going to kill myself why
does this keyboard have an afro it only
has
numbers thank you thank you and I I
don't know I think crunching in the end
is is is worth it
well no it's really not I I would
honestly prefer to not crunch so hard
I'd prefer to not have to render a video
on
stream but you know but you know but you
know
whatever you know it's fine it's all
good I'm going to eat my hands
oh wow oh wow oh wow oh
wow having F1 to F12 was nice and all
but what about f-13 to f24 they should
really have a second row of function
keys that' be really
funny that' be great that was funny not
going to lie what what mean rendering a
video in the middle of a collab you know
I want to play
games I want to play games there are key
codes for F1 to f24 but nobody makes
keyboards of them anymore
why man that's like another 12 macrobes
you can set up whoever removed f-13 to
f24 was a fool they thought they thought
they couldn't they thought we didn't
need those 12 function keys but nowadays
we have returned
to needing those function keys just
kidding we don't actually need that many
function keys but having those function
keys would be really
funny larger Tech G keyboards notably
the g15 has 18 extra function keys I
have not built a keyboard with my jelly
key caps yet I haven't is using the same
keyboard I need a new good base for it
do I do
I okay I think I think okay I think I
got it I think I got it I'm like
thinking about what keyboards I
currently have and I have one with like
cinemar key caps I think I'm replacing
that with the Jelly caps I have been
clean from
keyboard for a long time I have been
clean
I haven't
bought a new
keyboard in a
year I have been just switching key caps
I haven't spent any I have exited the
keyboard Rabbit Hole are you proud of me

from Pokemon cards I used to be addicted
to buying Pokemon card packs boxes was
the one to use in your hand cam this was
my um thy keyboard it's not really thy
but it's my uh how do I pull out of the
key
caps this was
I really like the sound of it so now
Shea is addicted no I'm safe because I
don't really care much for the new um
for new sets unless they release a car
pack with my favorite character in it I
don't care I didn't play any of the
expansions so I'm trying to pull out
this
keyboard key cap with my fingers but
it's not working okay there we go um
this one's cherry wine wine W rine oh my

yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah and this and these these caps
are pretty cute I don't know what
they're called but they're pretty
cute anyways I don't use linear I don't
I don't really use tactiles that often I
went ahead and bought like 12 tactiles
for my fight stick fight pad the
leverless fight
stick clicky gang ew
what the heck we got a clicky we got we
got a clicky guy we got a clicky guy in
chat we got a clicky
guy gazio bubble gums are really nice
silent lers I um I was using uh
different kind of Silence I was I was
using uh was I used to be really into
linear I had like a really good setup
but then the base kind of crapped out on
me so I need to find a new frosted
acrylic
base what the heck is a clicky it's the
ones that sound disgusting it's the ones
that sound
like it's a
blues clicky Justus this you're insane I
used clickies when I was like
14 do you do you not grow out of
clickies lineer is overrated you're
overrated I mean I'm kind of getting
back I'm kind of getting into tactiles
to be
honest I'm kind of getting into tactiles
I think linear are cool because they
sound really
smooth like I think linear sound really
good typ Rider Rock keyboard I don't
know I really like deep like
Thy like like bubbly s sounds I don't
know I think those are nice I have a
bunch of other keyboards I think in a
drawer somewhere I have a silenti one
that uses jelly Palms the ones with that
are engraved on the
side are engraved on the sides so like
the top of the keyboard is like clear
like this exact same one also it has a
frost base so it looks really good it
looks like edible
but then the base crapped out so I'm
cooked now I'm cooked I can't use it
anymore because sometimes I would be
typing and then one of the keys would
like hang you know like I'll be like
like typing something like um yes and
then the S would like stick and it would
go
like you like Cherry MX red keys I don't
know much about them thank you
Anonymous if my keyboard doesn't wake up
my neighbors I don't want it I know I
used to have like a blue clicky keyboard
and I would like play games until 3:00
in the morning and then my keyboard
would be so loud awake like it would
like notify my parents that I was awake
when I was still living with them and
they would get really mad so I'm kind
of I'm kind
of I'm kind of done with loud keyo you
know like flicky ones it's like it's
like I've
got I've got
PTSD
trauma yeah
trauma only use loud clickies in your
office like a public office like a
cubicle like a cubicle in your
office Brown switches are nice now I've
never heard that before I think they're
whatever but I know some people despise
despise Browns they think it's like
disgusting they think it like feels like
it's in between a linear at a tactile
and it's sticky and sick I know some
people say
that yeah
mushy yeah
anyways yeah brown brown switches man
don't twist my words don't get it
twisted
you swear by your Browns I mean I don't
