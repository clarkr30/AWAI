00:28:14: defeat ah I
00:28:21: see that's
00:28:21: insane how long were you on that one
00:28:23: level again I don't want to talk about
00:28:25: it
00:28:32: okay I get it I get it so we need do
00:28:35: Baba is word Baba is you and Baba is hot
00:28:40: so what the heck is that rock for oh
00:28:53: pull H okay okay okay I got it okay okay
00:28:53: I got it so we got to lock one of these
00:28:55: Bros in
00:29:03: okay we're locked in
00:29:03: I we can't go to the
00:29:22: right how's that possible
00:29:25: then we got lock it in over to the right
00:29:34: side premature lock
00:29:48: init
00:29:50: what okay so so so so so the sentences
00:29:53: we got to make is Baba is float Baba is
00:29:57: you Baba is hot and Baba is
00:30:03: word so there's one over here one Baba
00:30:07: over here which means we have got to
00:30:08: have one regular Baba up
00:30:20: here and then we got to do one Baba
00:30:20: is what the heck
00:30:28: man it's can't be that hard
00:30:28: there's like some indents over at the
00:30:37: top which is for I I presume to make
00:30:37: these
00:30:43: words so what if we
00:30:43: did we can do this right this is
00:30:48: possible let's restart we can do this I
00:30:52: think
00:31:17: what the heck this one's got to be one
00:31:19: up I
00:31:25: that no but now now it doesn't fit in
00:31:25: the what the
00:31:33: what the what the what what the what
00:31:35: what the what what the
00:31:37: what is this supposed to happen
00:32:11: ah H what
00:32:19: if what
00:32:19: if what if
00:32:38: imagine
00:32:55: imagine imagine
00:33:13: imagine wait this is really hard I don't
00:33:16: know how to navigate through this maze
00:33:18: without like breaking
00:33:28: something how
00:33:34: okay we probably have to do this like
00:33:40: um okay so we'll stick one Baba in
00:33:53: here so when when it's down
00:33:53: here we need it to float
00:33:58: and go to the
00:34:18: how oh wait
00:34:29: wait
00:34:34: what no the point of the rock is to lock
00:34:36: in the baba but there's like three slots
00:34:40: up there
00:34:52: right if I lock in the Baba
00:35:05: whatever oh my God I'm so
00:35:08: confused oh my God I'm so confused no I
00:35:11: I could get a third baba but but
00:35:19: but but what is the
00:35:22: point if I got a third Baba right
00:35:40: I got a third Baba right what is the
00:35:42: point of
00:35:43: this really can you put a job on your
00:35:46: shirt it can't do
00:35:48: D can't do
00:35:51: CH can do
00:35:54: JS congrats on your adorable than it
00:35:56: this yes thank
00:35:59: you how do you get to force
00:36:02: Baba what the heck I don't know if this
00:36:05: is the right configuration for
00:36:17: this there's another is for some reason
00:36:21: think it this large Al a l out what
00:36:31: I feel like I I kind of feel like this
00:36:32: might not be the best config I'm so
00:36:34: stupid I just
00:36:44: realized I've got to be like L IQ or
00:36:46: something I've got to be like low IQ for
00:36:49: sure
00:37:23: I
00:37:25: no okay okay okay
00:37:29: thank you eat voice for two mons are you
00:37:32: so cute jelly ah thank
00:37:35: you wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
00:37:38: wait wait wa wait
00:37:49: wait oh I see
00:38:07: see this is so stupid this is actually
00:38:07: unbelievably
00:38:16: stupid I see I see I see I
00:38:24: see I
00:38:26: see I see I see I
00:38:29: see I see I see I see I see so
00:38:50: clearly it's got to be the other way got
00:38:50: to be like from down to
00:38:55: up it's got to be from down to
00:39:20: up
00:39:20: you I just avoided $10,000 in taxes
00:39:24: let's freaking go are you sure you
00:39:26: should be telling me this
00:39:49: sec baa is
00:39:53: word no way
00:39:57: does it matter whether Baba is you or
00:39:59: Baba is I prefer Baba is you to be stuck
00:40:05: there does this matter wait what am I
00:40:07: supposed to okay so so Baba
00:40:10: is you is stuck there and then we have
00:40:13: do Baba is word I mean NE works right
00:40:47: okay I don't like this though it's like
00:40:51: different no
00:40:57: J I just heard really loud thunder
00:40:59: outside is scary oh no it's okay just
00:41:02: turn up my stream really really loud I
00:41:04: promise I won't blow your ears out more
00:41:06: than the Thunder did or
00:41:11: will
00:41:17: wait I guess Baba's word is equally as
00:41:20: important right but like now I'm locked
00:41:22: in to the
00:41:30: right it's going to be Baba is

00:48:00: block to the
00:48:16: right you find does it make sense you
00:48:19: know Jobo before s was invented we only
00:48:21: use

00:48:51: it's what the heck wait I I got it just

00:49:54: be down here
00:49:57: and there's got to be a baba over here
00:50:00: and this configuration doesn't make
00:50:01: sense so it should be Baba is you up
00:50:09: there but that also doesn't make
00:50:11: sense so we got to push the whole thing
00:50:14: up what by
00:50:19: one and then stack two Bubbas
00:50:31: am I stupid thank
00:50:31: you jell is the best B Tu I know she's

00:52:17: to make sure this one's higher up then
00:52:21: this
00:52:24: one okay so so this
00:52:31: so this one's got to be all the way up
00:52:31: here and this one's got to be all the
00:52:32: way down
00:52:36: here nothing more than I should
00:52:40: do but it's still ends up being all the

00:59:00: symbol m in McDonald's represents the
00:59:02: first letter in McDonald's which is
00:59:10: M no that's just it's not an M it's it's
00:59:10: not it's not a letter M it's two arches
00:59:11: it's
00:59:17: different no ha
00:59:17: English
00:59:19: no no wait
00:59:21: what no hav ESP

00:59:53: no face
00:59:53: yes me first m
00:59:57: I should uh I should du a lingo this I
00:59:59: should get I should do a dual lingo
01:00:00: stream I think that would be that would
01:00:02: be PE
01:00:06: content I didn't how to solve
01:00:10: this I don't know where to
01:00:25: start do you know two archers and
01:00:25: McDonald logo represents the first
01:00:27: letter in McDonald's which is M wow
01:00:29: crazy
01:00:32: insane okay is there something is there
01:00:35: something I got to
01:00:49: do
01:00:49: okay what what what that stuff at the
01:00:54: top is all a bit
01:00:57: what up what
01:01:11: up good one L thank you's easy we learn
01:01:11: Spanish drink
01:01:13: tequila is tequila
01:01:23: Spanish
01:01:23: imagine no but every empty k kills you
01:01:26: right every empty kills
01:01:34: you every empty kills you and pip is
01:01:34: stop if every okay if every empty kills
01:01:42: you
01:01:42: then then I wouldn't be able to make it
01:01:45: over here
01:01:52: anyways so there must be a different
01:01:52: way to get past this
01:02:07: unless you stack yourself no you would
01:02:07: still die because you'd be near
01:02:09: empty if it was Baba on MTS de feed like
01:02:14: that would make more that that would be
01:02:16: a bit easier yes tequila is from Mexico
01:02:19: so yes Spanish wow what about vodka
01:02:23: where's vodka from
01:02:25: where's where's where's uh where's
01:02:30: where's what
01:02:34: where's what is jacket with whiskey
01:02:36: where's whiskey from
01:02:40: Russia where's whiskey whiskey from the
01:02:44: liquor store thank you
01:02:53: vodka what the move is ex a single pipe
01:02:53: I can't even get I can't even get there
01:02:55: bro I like literally die if I get there
01:02:57: if I if I walk over
01:02:59: here Scotland oo I like whiskey wait no
01:03:05: I'm say so I hate
01:03:07: drinking where's beer from beer is like
01:03:09: everywhere
01:03:13: right than you son me vtuber what you
01:03:18: cannot push a two piece no I can't it's
01:03:22: stop so there's got to be a way to
01:03:32: uh
01:03:32: is doesn't make sense you're not
01:03:34: supposed to be able to push
01:03:42: empty empty move doesn't work empty is
01:03:42: push doesn't work Bubba is
01:03:50: move also doesn't
01:03:50: work Bubba is push
01:03:57: also doesn't
01:03:57: work so the the closest thing to
01:04:00: something that might work is Baba's push
01:04:02: Baba's move but where the heck is B
01:04:05: moving
01:04:20: uh
01:04:21: what how does this work what
01:04:30: what what
01:05:00: Baba is currently sink but there are no
01:05:00: objects on Baba so Baba is
01:05:09: safe near empty I'm near empty
01:05:09: right
01:05:23: what I'm on empty but being on empty
01:05:23: also means you are in you are near empty
01:05:27: look what's next to me is
01:05:36: empty you can't sink into anything that
01:05:36: makes that makes more sense I think you
01:05:39: need a tow to sink into yeah that makes
01:05:41: a little bit more sense
01:05:42: actually um anyways I'm stuck
01:05:48: here sorry I can't read what you just
01:05:56: said you
01:06:05: I I I can't that's some Advanced

01:26:16: can change
01:26:21: star we can't change belt but we can
01:26:21: change star because belts would ruin
01:26:24: flag is
01:26:31: win so let's make
01:26:47: Star okay now we have star dingy Tong
01:26:51: for the

01:27:43: yes
01:27:45: star we can't have ha we can't do star
01:27:47: ha at the same time it's got to be
01:27:50: something has
01:28:03: ghost is Ghost and
01:28:03: stop
01:28:12: um we can't do ghost has either star oh
01:28:12: star has love love is melt and
01:28:15: love star is
01:28:19: melt we can do
01:28:21: hot do Bell is hot
01:28:54: stress
01:29:05: this is so complicated
01:29:42: I think we've done like the easier
01:29:42: version of this the alternate version of
01:29:44: this level this like the alternate
01:29:45: version of another
01:29:47: level
01:29:49: um I don't know where to start there's
01:29:52: too many things too many too many
01:30:31: can we do anything to the to the Belt
01:30:33: can we do anything at all to the
01:30:36: Belt we can't
01:30:38: right we can't make it fall we can only
01:30:41: make it
01:30:52: hot but you don't make it
01:31:01: hot melt is melt you can't we can't make
01:31:01: melt M up
01:31:03: there why not love is hot cuz there's no
01:31:06: love lovess this level is
01:31:17: Loveless is this a game yeah I'm playing
01:31:17: a game called Baba you it's a really fun
01:31:23: game
01:31:25: what is this level called again what do
01:31:27: you want to you want to what you want to
01:31:29: look up the answer for this it's called
01:31:30: meteor strike ABC exra
01:31:38: One Love is
01:31:41: what I think the game is playing you I'm
01:31:44: being played I'm being played
01:31:58: Star as fall yeah but what's the point
01:31:58: you
01:31:59: know I could do star as fall but then it
01:32:02: just fall here right down
01:32:15: here okay okay the whole
01:32:20: thing is basically
01:32:26: thinking
01:32:26: about what to do
01:32:31: here
01:32:34: star is
01:32:37: fall would be here we would want it so
01:32:39: fall
01:32:41: here fall if if this Falls all the way
01:32:44: here we won't be able to reach it
01:32:46: anyways so it could fall
01:32:49: here but then we can't do anything to
01:32:53: skull that's a thing
01:32:57: rat
01:33:11: R ideally we want the belt to change
01:33:11: into something that
01:33:13: doesn't
01:33:16: move but all these things they
01:33:28: rat
01:33:28: rat belus
01:33:30: ghost but then we lock out fall
01:34:06: I think I know the
01:34:12: problem I think I saw the issue I think
01:34:12: I see the issue now
01:34:27: so belt is Ghost and star is
01:34:32: fall has to be during at the same
01:34:39: time I see the
01:34:42: issue so I'm pretty sure last level this
01:34:46: block might not have been there or
01:34:48: somewhere around here must have changed
01:35:15: f is
01:35:17: Ghost and
01:35:19: star is um
01:35:30: belt is g h
01:35:33: oos Hi H W welcome hello good

01:56:09: Baba
01:56:09: Baba uh wall wall is Rock
01:56:25: La
01:56:25: is
01:56:27: rock and then
01:56:30: Baba
01:56:33: on
01:56:36: Baba on
01:56:39: rock
01:56:40: is
01:56:50: ball what the heck
01:56:57: wait there we go now we just put
01:57:03: the we just put the rock in the just put
01:57:06: the the wall in the The Rock in the wall
01:57:08: we put the rock in the
01:57:11: wall we'll put the rock in the
01:57:20: wall we put the rock in the wall
01:57:23: we have successfully put the rock in the
01:57:30: wall but how am I going to get Baba onto
01:57:44: the how how is this physically possible
01:57:47: how is this physically possible H how is
01:57:50: this physically possible how is is
01:57:52: physically possible shift shift got got
01:57:55: to shift something got to got to shift
01:57:56: got to got to do the shif in got to
01:58:06: shift all right I've got my glasses on
01:58:09: we're gaming
01:58:13: now caveman
01:58:16: discovers we got to put we we did it we
01:58:19: put the rock in the wall we put the rock
01:58:21: in the wall the wall in the
01:58:28: Rock The Rock in the
01:58:28: wall
01:58:30: insane
01:58:41: okay I don't know what to do I don't
01:58:41: know what to do I don't know
01:58:43: I okay so we put the wall in the Rock by
01:58:49: doing bab on rock is wall but I feel
01:58:52: like wall is got has got to be one of
01:58:55: the last
01:58:56: steps I feel like we might have to shift
01:59:00: the
01:59:07: wall we might have to shift the Rock and
01:59:11: text I mean the wall and text into the
01:59:21: middle we might have to do something
01:59:21: like rock is sh
01:59:26: and then like plant it around the flag
01:59:26: you get
01:59:28: it so I'm just going to like I'm just
01:59:31: going to make these Babas the same thing
01:59:33: cuz it Doesn't it's pretty easy to make
01:59:44: Babas
01:59:44: so let's just focus on doing rockus push
01:59:47: for
01:59:53: now and by Baba's shift for now so we
01:59:53: can actually we don't need to do rock
01:59:55: his push we just need to do Baba's
01:59:58: shift wait a second doesn't this mean I
02:00:01: move really
02:00:03: fast
02:00:05: God God dang
02:00:19: it hi Jerry hope you're still sane
02:00:19: questionable
02:00:22: let's put this somewhere more accessible
02:00:27: like right here right here is pretty
02:00:30: accessible or we could stick it in here
02:00:32: that's pretty
02:00:40: accessible and now we can do
02:00:40: wall
02:00:47: is
02:00:52: W this
02:01:09: Rock what it's phrasing what did I
02:01:12: phrase what what what's what's wrong
02:01:14: with my
02:01:18: phrasing what did I say I don't remember
02:01:20: what I said I don't think it was that
02:01:22: bad what did I
02:01:24: say do you no longer need to Baba I do I
02:01:27: do but it's pretty easy to make Babas
02:01:30: just do a
02:01:32: baba
02:01:34: psych oh
02:01:36: fine but like two Bas just so annoying
02:01:40: you
02:01:44: know it's very annoying to deal with
02:02:04: and now I have to
02:02:14: do this
02:02:16: rock all right and
02:02:20: then what we can do is do Baba is
02:02:25: shift and get a rock onto the flag no
02:02:29: problem Baba into the
02:02:32: flag now the only problem is text and
02:02:37: Baba what I wanted to do
02:02:40: was to
02:02:59: is what I want to do is
02:03:08: this good night jelly and dark kns I'll

02:04:54: Babas and I I'll have just two stray
02:04:57: down here just so I can use them for
02:04:59: something if I
02:05:05: want and then we'll turn off Rock his
02:05:07: push let's think if we do rocket shift
02:05:47: okay so I'm going to do
02:05:50: this this is really convoluted I don't
02:05:53: know if this is the right
02:05:55: idea these two Babas are seriously
02:05:58: pissing me
02:06:14: off
02:06:20: Baba
02:06:28: on
02:06:31: rock
02:06:35: is wall all
02:06:38: right and then we're going to
02:06:42: plant a
02:06:44: Bubba right about
02:06:48: here all right and then also planned and
02:06:54: is right
02:07:01: about
02:07:19: difficult ah I think I get it it okay so
02:07:22: let's do rocket push
02:07:27: again let's just do rockus push again
02:07:30: and we will do one
02:07:34: down or we could just do one down like
02:07:37: that okay and then we'll do
02:07:42: Baba and then we'll do rock this shift
02:08:07: changing okay let's go back all the way
02:08:10: up
02:08:11: here let's go back
02:08:19: uh I wanted to not swap like
02:08:40: about we go from here to here and we'll
02:08:40: do rock is rock is shift
02:08:55: okay I think we need one extra yeah I
02:08:59: think we need one extra Rock for each of
02:09:02: these let's go back to when I turn Baba
02:09:04: into
02:09:12: wall
02:09:22: rewind and we need to do rock is push
02:09:22: one more
02:09:46: extra here okay and
02:09:46: then we're going to go one
02:09:49: down like that
02:09:52: okay this should
02:09:53: work and
02:09:55: then we'll go back to Baba on
02:09:59: rock is
02:10:07: W we'll turn this into a
02:10:11: wall and
02:10:13: then we will
02:10:15: do we put an is here and then we'll do
02:10:19: rock is shift
02:10:22: before I go and stand
02:10:24: on on the
02:10:27: thing there we
02:10:39: shift somewhere where I can go stand on

02:19:39: small
02:19:41: okay I mean there's barely any
02:19:48: game this the game play is not very
02:19:50: important as long as you can read the
02:19:52: words the game is really not that
02:19:59: important the world is called turn the
02:19:59: corner no that's the level man the level
02:20:03: is called turn the
02:20:08: cor I've already done this right I've
02:20:08: already done
02:20:14: this yeah I've already done that the
02:20:17: world is I'm not sure what that's called

02:20:31: tea I near only spilled tea all over
02:20:34: myself that would have been bad
02:20:59: it's going to be dust to stop and level
02:20:59: but I'm not sure how to get level out of
02:21:01: that
02:21:08: corner is there something we can do to
02:21:08: this
02:21:10: level I mean level is level why is level
02:21:14: is level maybe there's a maybe there's a
02:21:17: secret to level is
02:21:19: level do you mean coffee no I'm I'm

02:22:37: I really am a genius that means me self-
02:22:40: proclaiming that I'm a genius is
02:22:51: true but if I'm not a genius
02:22:51: and I self-proclaim myself as a
02:22:54: genius that would mean it's not
02:22:59: true but if what's 43 * 2 uh
02:23:06: 86 yeah but so so so but if

02:26:38: rock water is
02:26:38: sink I don't think water is sink is very
02:26:41: useful in the situations I'm going to
02:26:43: ignore that I think we're about the
02:26:45: water part think it's about dust
02:26:52: but how do you get the do
02:27:00: star

02:34:51: need to do here thank you Nick for two
02:34:53: months country of origin definition and
02:34:57: can you use it in a sentence what what
02:35:00: does that
02:35:02: mean there's level
02:35:06: there bro what the heck am I supposed to
02:35:08: do with the
02:35:09: level what
02:35:45: where is
02:35:45: hedge where is hedge into oh my God wait
02:35:48: a second
02:35:53: wait a
02:36:08: second wait a second wait a second wait
02:36:08: a
02:36:10: second
02:36:18: no wait what is there to do here there's
02:36:18: something to do here Cactus pushes level
02:36:21: is
02:36:31: weak is hedge stop balls also
02:37:09: here surely there's nothing you can do
02:37:09: here is there actually nothing I can do
02:37:12: here I don't think there's anything I
02:37:13: can do
02:37:38: word I don't think there's anything I
02:37:38: can do
02:37:39: here I don't think there's anything I
02:37:41: can do here
02:37:45: right I don't think there's anything to
02:37:47: do here right the Lev doesn't seem very
02:37:50: accessible in my
02:37:57: opinion there's a bug that allows you to
02:37:57: make level this text a bug I'm not some
02:38:02: bug I'm not some bug exploiter you think
02:38:06: I would exploit bugs in video
02:38:15: game that's not a bug
02:38:25: oh it's not a bug okay wait but let me
02:38:28: let me think about this how am I
02:38:31: supposed to get level out of
02:38:44: here I'm assuming like there's like
02:38:47: this this un
02:38:50: intended let's
02:39:01: see
02:39:05: okay okay well
02:39:50: you can't get push out of
02:40:23: there oh my God God uh what can we make
02:40:25: even okay everything we can make there's
02:40:28: not a lot so I think we can list them
02:40:30: down rock is
02:40:47: water Rock
02:40:50: water and water
02:40:57: sink
02:40:59: water
02:41:01: is
02:41:13: level might be sink be related to sink
02:41:17: sink is more important than I thought
02:41:20: water is
02:41:23: sink rock is sink
02:41:56: Rock oh
02:42:01: gosh let's go back to Rocket push first
02:42:50: word even if I
02:43:15: can the rock is sink but I'm not sure
02:43:19: what rocket sink is supposed to
02:43:24: do rocket push and sink we have an
02:43:35: and we can't do
02:43:35: that rock and water is sink and then
02:43:38: rock is
02:43:40: push we can't do that there's no space
02:43:56: there's no difference between doing
02:43:57: water sink and and rock and water sink
02:43:59: cuz we're not using water
02:44:14: um
02:44:14: rock
02:44:16: is Rock
02:44:19: water
02:44:26: is rock is push and level doesn't
02:44:26: matter Rock
02:45:19: is m
02:45:30: I generally don't get it I don't I I
02:45:33: don't I don't see any light you know how
02:45:35: you normally see like a light at the end
02:45:37: of the tunnel I don't see anything it's
02:45:39: just all
02:45:41: Darkness I am
02:45:43: enveloped in darkness by Darkness
02:45:49: I am the storm that is
02:46:14: um I'm a zit
02:46:17: man I check all the levels to see if
02:46:20: there's anything else with
02:46:27: level but since my chat said um you're
02:46:27: good then
02:46:30: I I trust
02:46:34: them that I trust that I already have
02:46:37: everything I need and the only thing I'm
02:46:39: missing is a little bit of intelligence
02:46:53: you
02:46:53: think I think
02:46:56: so oh not these fanade
02:47:11: levels yeah I I trust all right I
02:47:11: trust I
02:47:12: trust I I super trust I totally trust
02:47:19: mea
02:47:28: trust this was your first
02:47:30: mistake I think I'm
02:47:38: fine also I don't think there's anything
02:47:38: uh to do I think this is
02:47:41: it or something like
02:47:45: that why did I do that why I press space
02:48:00: bar hav't tried turnning rock into water
02:48:00: dude what's the
02:48:02: point what's the point we already have
02:48:12: water the thing is you can't take we
02:48:12: can't take any of the words along the
02:48:15: corner along the along the edges because
02:48:19: there's no way to push it out so
02:48:21: technically the only thing we can
02:48:23: actually push is rock is and and we can
02:48:26: push water sink left to right and right
02:48:28: to
02:48:33: left water is
02:48:49: sink okay
02:48:52: no we have already done Rock his level
02:48:54: and water is level we're trying to dust
02:48:55: his
02:49:01: level um if you see a pink borderer
02:49:01: around the things it means it's a level
02:49:03: and it's already
02:49:05: done let's see
02:49:26: I feel like sometimes chat lacks a
02:49:28: critical information so when I read it
02:49:30: it's just people tell me a new things
02:49:31: I've already
02:49:36: tried that's also why I
02:49:38: ignored why I ignored reading chat in um
02:49:41: T 100
02:50:03: thank you the B for
02:50:05: Theo thank you Pik for the raid welcome
02:50:14: everybody hello P Raiders
02:50:41: I a roughly sentient
02:50:43: being that's a very suspicious thing to
02:50:46: say imagine just is going up to somebody

03:01:46: man am I missing something I'm going to
03:01:46: be missing something
03:01:55: because I generally don't see I don't
03:01:55: see
03:01:56: it I don't see
03:02:01: it I thinking more
03:02:10: vertical try thinking more
03:02:11: vertical what
03:02:27: Doan
03:02:28: what I looked up the solution VOD
03:02:32: Watcher skip 20
03:02:34: hours no man no man no way

03:02:43: way
03:02:45: way way shouldn't be that long man way
03:02:57: man what what the heck is wrong with you
03:03:01: guys VOD Watchers give to reincarnation
03:03:04: in in another life no no man come
03:03:08: on come on come on come on come on come
03:03:11: on will you stream until you get it yes
03:03:15: I'll get the I'll get the dust levels
03:03:17: and then I'll oh
03:03:23: stop I would solve dust levels
03:03:24: probably
03:03:31: um what am I what am I
03:03:31: missing what am I
03:03:33: missing what is the something that I am
03:03:37: missing what is the something
03:03:48: a
03:03:49: boyfriend yeah and I'm
03:04:16: dead do you need DUS this level can't
03:04:16: you do DUS this something and then
03:04:17: something is
03:04:19: level like dust is rock and then rock is
03:04:23: level no because then the the the dust
03:04:26: would then it would be rocks being the
03:04:38: level it wouldn't it wouldn't be dust
03:04:41: this level
03:04:45: anymore it would just be it would just
03:04:45: be rocks as level right I mean I can try
03:04:49: are you serious that's so
03:05:02: stupid are you actually serious right
03:05:02: now cuz that would be really really
03:05:12: dumb because you're trying trying to do
03:05:12: dust's level not not not rock his level
03:05:15: we've already done Rock his level
03:05:19: put the rock
03:05:21: on yeah no yeah no like I I get how to I
03:05:26: have to move the rock over
03:05:28: here first I
03:05:34: think
03:05:34: uh different rocks then it wouldn't be
03:05:37: dust's level anymore then that would
03:05:39: just be rocks is
03:05:42: level the level is assigned to the
03:05:44: position on the
03:05:46: map what
03:05:51: no way dude cuz then if I did
03:06:06: level that would still end up being six
03:06:06: so that doesn't make any
03:06:08: sense levels are tied to objects
03:06:20: well that's well well well that's well
03:06:20: that's just
03:06:27: ridiculous
03:06:27: and
03:06:29: rock do this
03:06:48: Rock why the heck did I
03:06:58: this
03:07:01: rock oh bro can I even I need to do rock
03:07:05: his water
03:07:15: first I need to sink I need to sink out
03:07:15: the is to get the thing out
03:07:25: is it do I have to do
03:07:25: that hi Jer hi CH
03:07:29: hi I completely did not think that I I
03:07:33: was too focused on getting dust is level
03:07:36: and not dust is rock and rock is level
03:07:38: because rock is literally not level that
03:07:41: wouldn't be dust this level
03:07:46: anymore it's not not freaking dust
03:07:48: anymore man that's so stupid
03:08:07: man I split this
03:08:33: but then that would
03:08:34: be Rock would be stuck up
03:08:41: there
03:08:41: um so
03:08:48: this
03:09:25: hold on I'm I'm getting a brain fart
03:09:27: while I'm
03:09:39: here where do I where do I where do I do
03:09:47: this where do I do this
03:09:47: I got to do dust is
03:09:50: rock and then I need to get the rock
03:09:54: out but how do I get the rock
03:10:12: out if I
03:10:12: do rock I don't have the is to make rock
03:10:16: his level
03:10:21: what am I
03:10:21: doing oh dude there's an end okay
03:10:23: completely forgot about the
03:10:38: end completely forgot and
03:10:38: existed
03:10:50: what what was it going to do again dust
03:10:50: is
03:10:56: stop do do does this does this
03:11:02: rock dust wait what
03:11:06: dust and dust is
03:11:17: Rock oh then Rock and level is level
03:11:29: wait but how do I do water is
03:11:37: sink how I do how do I do how do I do a
03:11:37: rock is
03:11:43: water but but how do I but then but then
03:11:46: wouldn't it sink immediately when I put
03:11:48: the is in
03:12:07: there it'll trigger
03:12:10: first what is that
03:12:15: true what the heck it
03:12:22: does and
03:12:24: then Rock and oh my God I forgot about
03:12:27: this and man I was like there's no way
03:12:29: you're sinking the is cuz then you can't
03:12:30: make rock his
03:12:34: level
03:12:41: a a
03:12:49: right huh
03:13:44: I oh we got to do a winner what the

03:14:04: what no flag is defeat flag is defeat
03:14:04: look at the bottom left flag is
03:14:15: right let me make this game screen a
03:14:15: little bit bigger the game
03:14:33: Baba slag right
03:14:59: dude Jen you had it no man I didn't have
03:14:59: it
03:15:03: what wait so these weren't levels only
03:15:09: the what what what what then that's not
03:15:12: a dust level then
03:15:18: what the heck bro what wait what what
03:15:23: what is
03:15:24: this what is this
03:15:31: dot it's based on the object not the
03:15:36: type there's no way I could have know oh
03:15:38: rock is
03:15:40: push water sink do these things sink
03:15:44: okay they do
03:16:02: rock
03:16:05: is what the heck is this supposed to do
03:16:32: oh I
03:16:32: see I see
03:17:22: I had it oh wait
03:17:25: what oh right I just had to push it up
03:17:28: was it enough 1 2 3 4 5 oh six oh bro
03:17:35: okay I thought I had to duplicate I
03:17:37: thought I had to duplicate the number of
03:17:39: pushes I
03:17:43: got my brain's a bit cooked today
03:17:56: I was like there's no way this level can
03:17:56: be that simple
03:17:58: man it's just like one one thing it's
03:18:02: just one
03:18:13: thing oh now surely this is also just as
03:18:13: simple right
03:18:26: bird is stop and shut flag is wind water
03:18:28: is
03:18:34: sink it's simple every time all these
03:18:34: right levels are
03:18:36: simple fruit I've never seen fruit
03:19:25: 3 4 5 six fruit is open but fruit does
03:19:25: not
03:19:34: push first open but first not push so
03:19:38: we'll just
03:19:39: do uh push over here
03:19:53: bir is
03:19:59: stop then how do you open this
03:20:41: wa but now the bird doesn't go
03:20:41: through h
03:20:48: fruit is
03:20:50: push fruit is
03:20:55: open we rock is open instead of fruit is
03:21:01: open we rock is open it's up open how
03:21:05: Joy this fall but it's 4:30 a.m. let's
03:21:07: go yay good morning rise and
03:21:11: shine Sun's up in the morning
03:21:20: this means we need both
03:21:26: right H that's a bit tricky maybe we
03:21:29: have to finish writing everything we
03:21:31: need to write
03:21:44: here let me
03:21:44: think right huh
03:21:52: fruit is push no fruit is
03:21:54: push fruit is
03:22:01: p thank you golden
03:22:12: is
03:22:12: is Rock right Rock laau
03:22:28: no Rock right Rock and then we can kill
03:22:28: one rock and get the other Rock but what
03:22:31: is the
03:22:51: finish
03:22:53: Rock now we can do uh Ras push and Ras
03:22:58: open
03:23:19: can you do can you do something write
03:23:19: something of course you
03:23:21: can be
03:23:23: silly absolutely
03:23:35: silly but now I don't have enough things
03:23:35: to do though so maybe we actually do
03:23:39: have maybe we actually did have to use
03:23:42: fruit cuz now there's two fruits up
03:23:44: there that are not being used
03:23:59: fruit is push we couldn't have done
03:23:59: fruit is open maybe we could have done
03:24:21: wait what if it's just rock
03:24:21: is
03:24:23: oh with the bird doesn't that mean it
03:24:26: has to be both push and
03:24:29: open is there another way
03:25:03: is there another way for us
03:25:25: oh God this push mechanic is
03:25:28: crazy this push mechanic is
03:25:38: insane I think we have to use fruit I
03:25:38: think that fruit thing is pretty
03:25:41: useful I think this is right though oh
03:25:43: God uh
03:25:47: Rock right
03:25:53: open is it Rock right open and then we
03:25:53: use whatever it's is written to close it
03:26:21: Rock got to be something
03:26:25: else
03:26:26: Rock
03:26:34: right we have to
03:26:44: have I see I get it just
03:26:44: realized I am now a
03:26:50: where doesn't freaking matter what it
03:26:52: rides dude literally doesn't matter what
03:26:53: it
03:27:06: rides I had it I had it I had it um I
03:27:08: had it I had it I had it I had it I had
03:27:11: it I had it
03:27:17: wait wait I had it I had it I had
03:27:28: it
03:27:32: aheed I had
03:27:41: it I had it I had it
03:27:50: I have to stack two
03:27:53: words we have to stack two words fruit
03:27:56: has to be
03:27:58: pushed and
03:28:08: open fruit has to be push on
03:28:08: open so what do I have to write oh my
03:28:11: god dude what do I have to
03:28:15: write I have to
03:28:17: write rock into
03:28:31: push after pushing open on it
03:28:32: okay my bigest
03:28:36: life oh but then I don't have enough
03:28:38: stuff
03:28:46: to do I
03:28:46: I can get it out
03:28:48: right I just get these out
03:29:08: how but how but how
03:29:11: how do I have to do one of it
03:29:17: do both do two do
03:29:38: two so maybe not I don't have I can't do
03:29:42: push and open that soon
03:29:48: wait but how is this
03:29:57: possible cuz if we stack two
03:30:00: words 1 2 3 four 5 6 7even if we stack
03:30:03: two
03:30:04: words then we won't be able to finish it
03:30:23: right turns it into
03:30:27: text so
03:31:03: you can't stack two
03:31:16: words right we have a thing here we have
03:31:16: to kill one 1 2 3 4 5 6 seven
03:31:19: eight eight
03:31:27: no just going to kill a
03:31:36: rock can't stack to words you can't
03:31:39: stack to words can't to
03:32:02: but this is really
03:32:02: bad fruit is rock is
03:32:06: push fruit is
03:32:12: Rock but then we wouldn't be able to
03:32:13: have both of it that's really weird
03:32:47: ah does this
03:32:53: work let's this
03:33:11: work
03:33:11: wait turn the no wait no wait no doesn't
03:33:16: work cuz bird is stop if bird is stop is
03:33:20: it a 100% thing that something has to be
03:33:23: pushed and open to open the
03:33:27: bird it's got to have both properties
03:33:30: right push and push and open at the same
03:33:34: time
03:34:05: okay this right
03:34:06: thing I already did the right
03:34:17: thing this right is it is right even he
03:34:17: do fruit is right no no way you
03:34:20: can't
03:34:23: um you can't do push right you can't do
03:34:26: rock you can't do rock right cuz rock is
03:34:28: no more
03:34:29: right so right is a dead dead thing but
03:34:33: now we have a fruit maybe fruit is
03:34:40: Rock so we can turn the fruit back into
03:34:40: a rock what is the point why would they
03:34:43: give us a fruit just for it to be turned
03:34:44: into a rock
03:34:46: is that what the dev wanted us to
03:34:49: do is that why he gave us a noun as
03:34:52: special as
03:34:55: fruit did they want it to did they want
03:34:57: us to turn the the fruit into a rock or
03:34:59: did they want us to do the fruit as a
03:35:02: completely different thing
03:35:31: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7even there's seven here we
03:35:31: can't stack
03:35:50: there are seven things here we cannot
03:35:50: stack
03:36:00: anything what do you mean that means you
03:36:00: can't stack push onto open to only
03:36:03: utilize rock is push and open at the
03:36:05: same time to get past the
03:36:08: bird which means that the
03:36:11: bird something has to be pushed and okay
03:36:15: wait that's the thing right if something
03:36:16: is push and it has to look like
03:36:26: this we only have two available
03:36:40: things we only have two available blocks
03:36:40: to push into the water to sink it
03:36:47: because
03:36:53: there's
03:37:07: oh okay
03:37:31: is
03:38:10: first to me it wasn't to right push
03:38:15: maybe it suppos to
03:38:21: write something else I I still don't
03:38:21: know what's what the difference
03:38:27: is this writing this writing the other
03:38:27: thing
03:38:58: I don't know why should I have kept the
03:38:58: no now but now I have too many things I
03:39:01: want I
03:39:13: need what are we abandoning and are we
03:39:13: supposed to replace what we abandon
03:39:20: Fus Fus is
03:39:32: push are we really supposed to turn
03:39:34: fruit into rock are we really supposed
03:39:37: to turn fruit into rock I don't I don't
03:39:39: know I don't like that feel bad just
03:39:42: having fruit exist and just turning into
03:39:45: a Rock when it could have done something
03:39:50: else we don't have to write
03:40:06: yet we can't stack anything stacking is
03:40:06: illegal
03:40:17: we have to feed the bird with fruit okay
03:40:17: so it's got to be fruit right cuz then
03:40:19: they wouldn't do something as silly as
03:40:21: this they wouldn't give us a fruit and a
03:40:23: bird and expect us to not feed the bird
03:40:25: with the
03:40:27: fruit why
03:40:29: up so there's no way fruits fruit is
03:40:33: there to turn into a
03:40:39: rock there is no way I mean you can kill
03:40:42: a bird with a stone but I think that's a
03:40:44: bit cruel
03:40:45: you know why would you do that but that
03:40:48: might be that might be what the what the
03:40:50: what the dev thought about like they're
03:40:51: like they're like yeah I'm sure the
03:40:54: gamers are going to expect the fruit to
03:40:57: be fed to the bird so it goes away but
03:40:59: in reality you're supposed to kill a
03:41:02: bird with the
03:41:07: rock I mean two of these things are both
03:41:11: effective ways to get rid of birds
03:41:37: right
03:41:37: aha I get it
03:42:31: okay what the heck do this accomplished
