00:29:49: true thank you for super the jelly voice
00:29:52: pack cured my diabetes and gave me a
00:29:54: free Supa what a bargain thank you 420
00:29:56: no scope Cannon you're also a
00:30:01: liar Satan kicked me out saying that the
00:30:03: supas are free okay all right all right

00:30:09: hell isn't even
00:30:17: real you get an AAA if you buy all the
00:30:17: voice packs you're lying stop the Supa
00:30:20: was sponsored by Jelly's voice pack
00:30:22: thank you GS for the Super Chat and
00:30:23: thank you the seal boy for the Super
00:30:25: Chat stop
00:30:27: I can't believe how lwd your voice pack
00:30:29: was I didn't know you could do that all
00:30:31: right thanks arklite for the flat
00:30:40: out that's misinformation stop lying
00:30:40: stop my voice pack was not it's nothing

00:30:56: stay Welcome to the
00:31:04: dude it's not true stop stop stop
00:31:04: stop by the way if you buy voice packs
00:31:07: you don't have to pay for shipping and
00:31:09: you don't have to wait for
00:31:14: shipping stop stop it you're distracting
00:31:18: me I've been
00:31:20: distracted
00:31:22: stop
00:31:24: stop uh I'm going to just steal this
00:31:39: dying I literally got a better graphics
00:31:39: card and my frames are dying in
00:31:49: okay I'm just going to steal this cuz I
00:31:49: don't need any more
00:31:56: plastic close your tabs
00:31:56: no
00:31:58: does allocating more RAM make your make
00:32:00: your frames worse this is not a free
00:32:03: Super Chat thank you for the five old
00:32:05: Deuce thank you thanks for being honest
00:32:09: for once I really like
00:32:13: honesty honesty is kind of awesome so
00:32:15: it's really nice of you to be
00:32:18: honest I do have
00:32:21: Ram but I I allocated like 12 gigs of
00:32:24: RAM to my Minecraft I'm not not sure if
00:32:27: it's not sure if it's helping or
00:32:31: not thank you for the tip blank even
00:32:34: though we may go
00:32:36: to
00:32:38: what
00:32:44: what oh wow how convenient actual free
00:32:44: Super Chat thank you for the member
00:32:47: Canon that's just your
00:32:50: membership message sorry to bring it to
00:32:53: you thank you oh it's sensor as hell
00:33:00: wait let me read it let me read it
00:33:07: out even though we may go to hell for
00:33:07: this Heaven is whether is wherever we
00:33:09: have Jelly's voice pack
00:33:12: ah okay whatever I'm just going to stop
00:33:14: talking to I'm just going to stop
00:33:15: talking about it in hes that you will
00:33:18: all
00:33:19: forget that it
00:33:22: exists God why why do we have to do why
00:33:25: do why do we have to do freaking why
00:33:27: have to freaking do a freaking freaking
00:33:29: freaking freaking voice pack for
00:33:31: Valentine's Day huh I do I have to do
00:33:32: that I didn't even to do a voice pack
00:33:33: for my
00:33:34: birthday not to do it anyways I to do it
00:33:37: anyways for Valentine's Day can't run
00:33:39: forever I thought I was just excused
00:33:41: from voice packs forever why did I have
00:33:44: to write my own huh what why why wasn't
00:33:47: there script guy to write it for me huh
00:33:51: man this one's actually free stop
00:33:55: stying
00:34:01: I couldn't believe that one part of 3250
00:34:01: where you argued how vanilla Minecraft
00:34:03: is a more pure experience than modded it
00:34:04: was very out of qu it was a very out of
00:34:07: character
00:34:09: what thank you Mr here for the Super
00:34:11: Chat thank you old this super chat this
00:34:14: one is actually free all right now
00:34:15: you're lying I hate
00:34:18: liars okay perfect honesty this is not
00:34:20: free but the voice pack is worth it plus
00:34:22: you may be an angel jelly but also a
00:34:24: furry and they don't go have
00:34:33: what do you me very still going
00:34:41: happen is that true do F's actually not
00:34:41: go to
00:34:42: heaven he's
00:34:44: right why what did they do
00:34:48: wrong
00:34:58: they what why
00:34:58: gee with all this misinformation about
00:35:00: the voice pack I guess the only way to
00:35:02: find the truth is to buy it and listen
00:35:04: to it intently with deep focus thank you
00:35:06: for the
00:35:07: superin I mean fine I'll try a different
00:35:10: strategy whatever buy it if you want I
00:35:11: don't care I break a few bones go on a
00:35:15: silly sock vacation and come back to
00:35:16: jelly fully embracing her furry Arc 2024
00:35:19: is starting out strong I'm not a furry I
00:35:21: never embraced it I'm telling that guy
00:35:24: who keeps generating AI images of me
00:35:26: being a furry to stop hey jelly start
00:35:29: for the Super Chat by the way with my
00:35:30: new GPU I can finally generate my own my
00:35:33: own AI art and that's going to be real
00:35:43: cool no man not all furries are the
00:35:46: same not all furries are same and icky
00:35:49: some Furies are
00:35:55: fine all right I'm going to build this
00:35:55: thing
00:36:02: allocating too much can cause FPS spikes
00:36:02: just give your system around 25% of
00:36:04: leeway 16 gigs of RAM you can allocate
00:36:07: 10 to 12 gigs I have 64 gigs of RAM does
00:36:10: that mean I should allocate 48
00:36:17: gigs is that how that works Phantom
00:36:17: thank you for the Super
00:36:19: Chat I'm not a
00:36:22: furry stop calling me a
00:36:25: furry is it four 3x3 base or
00:36:31: what I need to Google this
00:36:55: uh
00:36:57: a 4x4 4x4 Block Base 4X
00:37:10: four 4x4 block
00:37:10: base with the height of three
00:37:42: enough just go very slightly over
00:37:42: recommended amount 12 gigs re allocate
00:37:44: too much of garbage collection will kill
00:37:45: your frame rate occasionally I mean I do
00:37:48: have I used to play on like 8 gigs now
00:37:51: I'm on like 12 not sure if it's any
00:37:54: better I ran out of blocks God
00:38:02: if you want him to stop why did you like
00:38:02: everyone all right I'll stop liking him
00:38:04: from now
00:38:05: on I just think he's a great I think
00:38:08: just I I just I just think that the
00:38:10: generations are real good you know so if
00:38:13: I like encourage him to stop generating
00:38:15: furry me maybe he'll generate some
00:38:17: regular images of me that I can
00:38:26: enjoy that's why that's my logic okay
00:38:26: they I think they are really good
00:38:29: right that's why it messes me up
00:38:38: man dude it's it's it's so messed up
00:38:38: it's it's actually so messed up oh my
00:38:41: God it's jelly hi that's
00:38:45: me
00:38:47: hi okay let's do this this this height
00:38:51: and I'll
00:38:53: uh so evve where
00:38:58: on the
00:39:22: works don't have to power this jelly
00:39:22: you've met real people right yes I've
00:39:24: met real people
00:39:27: these work a lot better in the desert oh
00:39:30: because of have
00:39:31: evaporation I am in the desert I'm in
00:39:34: the cold desert look top
00:39:48: work oh
00:39:48: yeah I might be a
00:39:55: fool
00:40:01: let's just make them all like this
00:40:01: height
00:40:11: probably all right that's a good that's
00:40:11: a good amount
00:40:14: um uh I'm going to switch
00:40:18: this this valve to be over
00:40:25: here
00:40:25: a just evve to be here and evve to be
00:40:35: here we'll do another valve here I'm not
00:40:35: sure what these vales are for one output
00:40:38: and one input I
00:40:53: presume temp 283
00:40:53: 28622 K is it is that
00:41:01: good um fluid or heat in or
00:41:20: something or
00:41:20: um cuz they're telling me to put some
00:41:22: Advanced solar
00:41:24: generators I just want to make the suit
00:41:27: this is just to make
00:42:06: hit um okay so
00:42:06: Bri Brian is made
00:42:09: from
00:42:11: water okay so literally just
00:42:25: water okay it literally can't be that
00:42:25: hard um
00:42:26: so I'm going to pipe in water into
00:42:46: here what the
00:42:46: heck fluids
00:42:50: fluids okay so water in the
00:42:54: here um
00:43:03: is it going to is it hot
00:43:03: enough this is not hot
00:43:06: enough all right so I should just go
00:43:09: make the solar generators
00:43:14: right inductive
00:43:30: I think I need to make these I think I
00:43:30: have to make
00:43:37: these
00:43:37: okay I can do this uh so it's three
00:43:41: per Jesus
00:43:56: Christ
00:44:01: out of
00:44:11: glass resistive
00:44:11: heaters what the resist of
00:44:24: heers I can make resist of heat do I
00:44:24: only need one
00:44:26: do we only need one
00:44:30: one with all you learned about nuclear
00:44:32: power can you make one that goes boom
00:44:34: are all having the materials blink twice
00:44:36: to say yes no I don't know how to make
00:44:39: an actual nuclear reactor that's
00:44:46: crazy so that needs
00:44:46: power it's
00:44:54: fine
00:45:06: it's
00:45:06: night good
00:45:19: night I thought you were a scientist and
00:45:22: you can't make a nuclear reactor
00:45:24: dropped I I'm only a scientist in
00:45:28: Minecraft it's
00:45:31: different it's
00:45:34: different holy frames I allocate too
00:45:37: much RAM okay so you're saying that I
00:45:40: only need to do
00:45:53: this right I need to power this right so
00:45:53: I'm going to pick one of the one of
00:45:55: these windmills
00:46:08: multiblock I put it on a
00:46:08: valve so I need to make two more
00:46:34: it's so hot in my room why is it so
00:46:34: hot
00:46:37: okay all right
00:46:40: uh okay I can put the heat in through
00:46:42: rolve do I need a heat pipe for this or
00:46:46: can I just put it on
00:46:54: evolve I need a thermop pipe oh
00:46:54: my
00:47:03: I should just dig a hole in the roof so
00:47:03: I can go in easier
00:47:07: ah
00:47:09: valve
00:47:26: valve Val
00:47:26: what the heck did just take damage
00:47:36: to
00:47:36: heat what what are what are the pipes
00:47:38: for
00:47:54: heat
00:47:54: thermal
00:48:18: conductor thank you for the
00:48:22: tip
00:48:24: okay
00:48:32: so so I uh break
00:48:36: this I a
00:48:39: valve
00:48:42: here B
00:48:44: here
00:48:46: too
00:48:48: right and then I get this
00:48:53: resist resistive Heat
00:49:04: heers I'm glad you're back I'm going to
00:49:04: be back
00:49:06: too and then I'm going to heat these
00:49:09: with wind
00:49:11: generators doesn't matter if it
00:49:13: sucks um I'm going to assume it doesn't
00:49:15: need much
00:49:24: heat do I have to stick the power in
00:49:24: here oh my
00:50:12: hot oh oh the brine the brine's coming
00:50:12: in oh sweet
00:50:16: awesome oh awesome I see the brine look
00:50:20: being
00:50:56: bra uh and now I just move the Bri over
00:50:56: I guess or something like
00:50:59: that
00:51:15: God okay uh and now it should turn into
00:51:15: liquid
00:51:17: lithium
00:51:26: yay H so we have liquid lithium
00:51:26: now which should put get put into a
00:51:29: chemical
00:51:30: crystallizer
00:51:33: right let me
00:51:35: see so liquid lithium we need a we need
00:51:47: condensator a condens trator into a the
00:51:47: thing
00:51:50: condensator a rotary cond
00:51:54: trator
00:52:08: crystallizer so we need some Elite
00:52:10: control
00:52:12: ciruits and need some regular
00:52:22: circuits need some basic control
00:52:22: circuits which is made from enriching
00:52:24: redstone enriching osmium with
00:52:35: redstone
00:52:54: okay isn't that a radioactive material
00:52:54: wait what
00:52:57: is lithium no no
00:53:08: way n this is good
00:53:08: enough we need some refined
00:53:11: obsidian which is refined obsidian
00:53:15: dust think we need
00:53:38: dust should we have find en Rich
00:53:38: obsidian right
00:53:39: here which we
00:53:42: will put it with a reinforced
00:53:46: alloy so how many do we
00:53:49: need so two for one so we need a total
00:53:52: of
00:53:53: four four of those
00:54:12: this so a tip your bran producing Tower
00:54:12: should be around 10 times the height of
00:54:13: your lithium producing tower for Peak
00:54:16: efficiency I could not care less about
00:54:18: the brine right now I don't think I need
00:54:20: that much brine right it's for
00:54:24: batteries
00:54:34: flash what's what's what's a
00:54:34: flask oh let's refine some
00:54:37: obsidian in the osmium
00:54:56: yes play that refine
00:54:56: Earl May flasks are a real thing not in
00:55:00: Minecraft and why would it tell me to
00:55:02: get an Earl May flask when I'm playing
00:55:11: Minecraft why would I need an earin
00:55:11: mayor
00:55:24: flask a chemistry I just I've always
00:55:24: called this conical
00:55:26: flasks do do do people not call them
00:55:29: conical flasks
00:55:36: anymore a con no
00:55:36: conical they're making a chemistry joke
00:55:39: I guess I'm just an
00:55:42: idiot I guess I guess I guess I'm just
00:55:44: dumb or
00:55:52: something uh okay it makes
00:55:52: me so uh
00:56:08: circuits
00:56:08: to wait
00:56:26: what wait what what what's going on
00:56:26: there's too many this is just gear
00:56:29: crafting
00:56:31: okay steel
00:56:33: casing and T of a chemical
00:56:37: crystallizer
00:56:39: yippee
00:56:42: oh glad to see you're not recreating the
00:56:44: fall Universe with more reactor
00:56:47: incidents thanks I'm doing my
00:56:54: best I would say this is actually going
00:56:55: pretty well all things
00:56:58: considered the door not working
00:57:00: considered uh it's night time I'm going
00:57:02: to go to
00:57:10: bed ear me your flask is the American
00:57:10: term kind of go flas is the British
00:57:12: Commonwealth term I'm not I'm not a
00:57:15: chemistry I'm I'm not that big of a
00:57:17: chemistry nerd all
00:57:20: right have a learnt these
00:57:23: things
00:57:28: I think chemistry is pretty awesome
00:57:28: though I would have I would have taken
00:57:31: that as my major if I
00:57:34: uh if I tried a little harder in um High
00:57:39: School okay so I'm going to have to
00:57:51: play
00:57:53: welcome
00:58:01: uh sorry about that guys um didn't
00:58:01: didn't ask you to come over to trade but
00:58:04: I appreciate the
00:58:06: effort why do you do
00:58:09: that
00:58:12: okay we need more Advanced Mechanical
00:58:23: pipes I think this should be
00:58:23: enough let's go get our
00:58:26: lithium
00:58:28: coming I'm stone cold I'm totally not
00:58:31: stone
00:58:44: cold I'm
00:58:44: warm liquid lithium
00:58:48: pull we'll pull
00:58:51: this we'll pull this
00:58:56: um do I not have any
00:58:59: more cables I need more cables cuz these
00:59:02: need to be
00:59:14: powered you know what I'm just going to
00:59:15: make
00:59:25: a
00:59:25: I'm just going to make a ter I'm just
00:59:26: going to make a wireless
00:59:28: grid I'm
00:59:35: done I'm going to make a wireless
00:59:35: crafting monitor crafting
00:59:43: grid I'm I'm tired of this I'm sick I'm
00:59:44: tired I'm

01:02:23: fine
01:02:24: L your quartz and riched
01:03:11: sucks network
01:03:11: card it's a network
01:03:19: card making more transmitters these are
01:03:22: so
01:03:23: expensive
01:04:09: this really really sucks this is like
01:04:10: Giga sucks but at least I can go up
01:04:12: there and make and craft things like
01:04:14: here I guess it's I guess it's slightly
01:04:16: better than having none of it at
01:04:23: all but this kind of sucks this just

01:07:34: been mad in a long
01:07:40: time it's pretty hard to piss me off
01:07:40: pick me
01:07:47: no no I would
01:07:47: never I would
01:08:00: pow pow I'm going to assume that this

01:08:17: working this is working it's like not
01:08:17: going
01:08:21: in do I have to

01:09:12: don't think it's I don't think anything
01:09:14: warrants my
01:09:16: energy like cuz you know being angry is
01:09:19: a lot of energy and I don't have enough
01:09:20: energy to like spend being like actually

01:10:49: dust I need more uh more of these
01:11:28: y I got lium
01:11:29: dust yay we have lithium dust now we can
01:11:34: finally make this battery
01:11:41: thing fire aspect Mason teleport every
01:11:41: tick of
01:11:44: damage ah whatever um let's make the
01:12:11: tablets so I'm assuming
01:12:11: that I'm assuming that wait a
01:12:23: second I'll put it into the ender chest
01:12:23: and not run
01:12:30: around where's the ender
01:12:30: chest
01:12:39: cuz I don't want to waste another Pearl

01:14:06: average four of
01:14:09: these
01:14:10: four right four no am I stupid oh no I'm
01:14:15: not
01:14:16: stupid oh I need Atomic alloy so I need
01:14:19: to enrich more obsidian refined obsidian
01:14:22: dust is made with
01:14:24: powdered obsidian and
01:14:33: Diamond okay I'm just going to grind
01:14:33: some
01:14:41: obsidian andr
01:14:41: diamond and enr some
01:14:50: Diamond girls don't know how to adjust
01:14:50: your seat of course I know how to adjust
01:14:53: my
01:15:04: see I'm
01:15:04: lob I'm lovable and
01:15:06: lob please don't please don't throw me
01:15:10: and my bones will
01:15:16: break obsidian
01:15:16: dust let's Infuse
01:15:31: let's
01:15:38: Infuse I feel
01:15:38: some
01:15:54: obsidian wa
01:15:54: obsidian has been
01:15:56: refined I need to dust more
01:16:07: obsidian
01:16:07: dust obsidian
01:16:16: dust s dust
01:16:16: is from an enrichment
01:16:19: chamber so enriching some obsidian
01:16:36: dust ref find obsidian
01:16:36: dust
01:16:49: um did I make too much
01:16:49: diamond oh I I think I made too much
01:16:51: diamond oh whatever
01:16:54: okay
01:17:02: so this thing Atomic
01:17:02: alloy enriched obsidian into reinforced
01:17:07: alloy
01:17:12: reinforced
01:17:12: alloy would be diamond dust infused
01:17:42: enough okay yeah that's pretty good uh
01:17:42: now
01:17:45: um
01:17:47: now with this I need a Tomic
01:17:51: caloy which is
01:17:54: enriched enriched
01:18:06: obsidian into T into D into the
01:18:06: reinforced
01:18:15: alloy so how many do I need per
01:18:15: two so 2 468 I need
01:18:41: perfect now I put
01:18:41: off one two three
01:18:44: four okay and now I can
01:18:48: make this oh now I can make
01:18:51: this
01:19:00: four basic energy cubes one two three
01:19:02: four
01:19:13: then and then and
01:19:13: then I think I'll make new netherite
01:19:17: armor does it carry over if I take off
01:19:20: this
01:19:21: and
01:19:36: gear it doesn't carry over okay so it's
01:19:36: a waste if I do that um I want to make
01:19:39: completely new netherite gear so that
01:19:42: involves
01:20:20: okay another my diamond
01:20:20: Gear with another right oh how do I make
01:20:24: netherite Ingot
01:20:26: again netherite scrap was for diamond
01:20:29: for
01:20:37: gold okay so
01:20:57: I'm made a mega
01:20:57: suit
01:20:59: yay ah I need HTP pellets and
01:21:04: sheets
01:21:22: ah
01:21:25: okay okay
01:21:32: armor I need more lithium
01:21:32: dust okay I need to go down I need to go
01:21:34: to bed before things
01:21:36: spawn hello
01:21:54: Mimi all right okay
01:22:08: lithium
01:22:08: acquired cell

01:22:30: shoes I have the full set can I get bed
01:22:35: time please enjoy your bedtime are you
01:22:38: going to crash a server with a nuke the
01:22:40: stream I'm not
01:22:41: sure I'm going to get the flying
01:22:50: mod cuz I think there's like a bunch of
01:22:50: modules for
01:22:51: mechanism
01:22:54: yeah like these do I need to get energy
01:23:05: units but um yeah so so I have
01:23:05: these oh my
01:23:17: God help who's this who am
01:23:21: I
01:23:34: like why why do I look like this why do

01:23:48: smaller with the hat
01:23:51: on do can I
01:23:53: like can I like have a have a module
01:23:56: where I like where I can have my regular
01:24:00: head you know for the for the
01:24:11: Aesthetics ah an to
01:24:11: matter maybe I should make some energy
01:24:13: units should I make some energy units
01:24:16: feels like a good
01:24:24: idea
01:24:36: okay energy units basic induction cell
01:24:36: Basic Energy q1 two three
01:24:42: 4 basic induction son need more energy
01:24:47: tablet I ran out of I ran out of
01:24:51: alloys the modules of the purple names
01:24:53: with
01:25:45: by the way what's nuke
01:25:48: resistant I need an item I need a block
01:25:51: that's nuke
01:26:23: resist
01:26:23: obsidian bedrock and yeah it's an
01:26:26: Infinity nuke
01:26:27: resistant Panzer glass is Panzer glass
01:26:30: actually Infinity n
01:26:32: resistant this is this is extremely
01:26:34: important by the
01:26:37: way it's very very

01:34:52: Elite control
01:34:59: circuit made more Atomic Alloys are you
01:34:59: serious you're serious right now how
01:35:01: many freaking Atomic Alloys do I need
01:35:05: huh okay whatever I'm going to make the
01:35:07: tool
01:35:22: this
01:35:22: I need to charge

01:35:39: good can it be huh I'm going to go over
01:35:41: to I land and test it out I should
01:35:44: probably get the mechan the Mecha table

01:35:50: very anxious is what the
01:36:05: heck okay soic gway

01:36:51: lagging make sure to sit at the max
01:36:51: setting I'll try I'll
01:37:02: try so toic alloy would be a diamond
01:37:02: reinforced
01:37:04: alloy how many do I
01:37:11: need
01:37:11: four reinforc dooy with
01:37:15: obsidian enriched

01:43:57: electrolytic oh this is the one I
01:44:00: want
01:44:02: electrolytic breathing
01:44:15: unit what about this inhalation
01:44:15: purification unit applies a miniature

01:44:40: unit I'm going to get this for a good
01:44:43: measure I'm going to get some energy
01:45:00: the nuke penetrates all blocks even
01:45:00: Bedrock
01:45:02: really
01:45:05: o are you
01:45:07: serious it breaks
01:45:16: Bedrock that means we can we can make a
01:45:16: hole into the
01:45:19: void
01:45:25: it's kind of crazy oh it doesn't break
01:45:25: it what doesn't it break then I just
01:45:27: need to know what it doesn't
01:45:36: break Tetra ruin blocks are
01:45:45: immune okay what ignore what's ignored
01:45:45: by the
01:46:07: know R out of this R out freaking tin
01:46:07: inot no I ran out of

01:46:14: to smelt
01:46:16: it I can't be
01:46:19: bothered
01:46:34: hydrogen okay a bunch of energy units in
01:46:34: here I will
01:46:36: now get
01:46:39: this put it in
01:46:41: here um give it the electrolytic
01:46:44: breathing
01:46:46: unit what why was it does it not
01:46:49: work
01:46:58: oh
01:46:58: helmet okay
01:47:00: then energy unit first doubles
01:47:05: it wait do I need the radiation
01:47:07: shielding unit for every
01:47:33: okay
01:47:33: read hi my name is jelly
01:47:37: um I don't know how to
01:47:45: read I never freaking learned how to

03:37:21: P just one more end ship actually
03:37:25: theoretically 67 helium balloons 0.03 lb

04:08:49: dragon scale
04:08:50: for H what a draco arcan
04:09:11: oh it's to make the end game endgame
04:09:11: armor okay I
04:09:14: remember so how many other dragons do I
04:09:17: have to kill for
04:09:18: that Dragon s sinu
04:09:32: senu uh and stone smelter ah yes for
04:09:32: this but to make this I can
04:09:35: just I can just smelt it normally
04:09:38: right Ark
04:09:40: furnaces with
04:09:48: talium wait
04:09:48: what oh for ter terminite for
04:09:52: terminite for termin KN
04:09:55: night oh is this literally the only
04:09:59: way oh I guess it's really the only
04:10:14: Ender dust and iron sand Ender dust is
04:10:14: made from
04:10:16: smashing ender
04:10:31: pearls
04:10:31: bo
04:10:33: boo
04:10:35: boo boo
04:10:39: I'm so
04:10:52: tired that was soent fall I
04:10:52: mean at least today we did
04:10:56: this oh yeah we should make like an
04:10:59: ender chest
04:11:06: thing and like
04:11:06: the
04:11:12: ender
04:11:12: chest
04:11:15: chest ender
04:11:18: chest and should make
04:11:21: this
04:11:23: pipe
04:11:26: pipe not this
04:11:36: transport transport trans logistical
04:11:36: transporter
04:11:43: I feel like I didn't do anything
04:11:43: productive you know like I didn't like I
04:11:46: didn't get I didn't get anything done I
04:11:48: just explored and found some
04:11:52: things and stuff configure
04:12:08: items
04:12:08: put it here like this like
04:12:33: transported
04:12:33: oh I determined that Ender dragons are
04:12:36: nuke proof I I honestly think that it
04:12:38: would just insta kill it but I guess I
04:12:41: guess it's just not good
04:12:43: enough um but we
04:12:46: unlocked we unlocked the
04:12:50: uh chest
04:12:52: plate making the crystalite chest plate
04:12:56: or which one was it which one was the
04:12:57: best one
04:13:05: again was like talium and then something
04:13:05: is a crystalite
04:13:16: something I can just press U on
04:13:17: this I think crystalite might be the
04:13:21: best
04:13:27: maybe the my armor was a downgrade for
04:13:27: sure
04:13:29: um cuz I have all of these protections
04:13:33: on it and like for some reason the power
04:13:35: just isn't good enough
04:13:42: just going to stand here and get
04:13:42: charged okay anyways Draco is the
04:14:02: bad like it's just not that bad just of
04:14:02: sitting
04:14:04: ingots it's six six
04:14:15: three 63 oh this is 3
04:14:15: three um what
04:14:17: about crystalite isn't even
04:14:30: close I guess Draco really is the best
04:14:30: meas is only made for industrial St
04:14:32: industrial stuff and not actual combat
04:14:35: okay true I don't think it's a waste of
04:14:36: time to have made
04:14:38: that but um it's really mining right I
04:14:42: don't want mine
04:14:48: anymore
04:14:48: okay Draco and P
04:14:56: armor oh Tera is Terra is actually
04:14:56: better

04:23:37: I haven't done the I haven't done a
04:23:38: thumbnail but I'll do the thumbnail soon
04:23:41: you know actually Minecraft like all
04:23:43: this Minecraft it's just a it's just an
04:23:47: excuse for me to not how to do any
04:23:50: thumbnails cuz I'm actually really lazy
04:23:52: at doing
04:23:53: thumbnails you think I should hire
04:23:55: somebody to do my
04:24:03: thumbnails I'm so
04:24:03: lazy graphic design is not my passion
04:24:08: no but it kills the mood you know to
04:24:10: open Photoshop and wait 10 seconds for
04:24:12: it to launch and then add like a number
04:24:14: to the top left of the of of the
04:24:16: thumbnail and people tend to click less
04:24:20: if there's a freaking
04:24:21: number because like does iro do
04:24:25: thumbnails iro edits his thumbnails in
04:24:30: in After Effects so no he cannot do
04:24:33: thumbnails I'd rather die than have him
04:24:35: do my thumbil
04:24:41: thumbnails I do my own thumbnails I keep
04:24:41: doing my own
04:24:49: thumbnails but yeah what was I going to
04:24:49: say I'm going to put all these streams
04:24:58: into into
04:24:58: uh once once the arc
04:25:07: concludes
04:25:07: I'll put them all into
04:25:09: a a playlist so you can binge watch it
04:25:13: if you like Yeah from the very
04:25:15: beginning uh-huh it a playlist yeah
04:25:19: sorry
04:25:21: yes I'm sorry I'll put it on a playlist
04:25:24: and I'll number it uh in the title
04:25:27: instead of in the
04:25:33: thumbnail I don't know how many hours
04:25:33: I've played how many hours have I played
04:25:35: cuz I played a little bit off stream
04:25:37: before I started so it's not like I
04:25:39: started from
04:25:42: nothing when I started streaming it
04:25:44: quick question after this would you be
04:25:46: changing games completely or just change
04:25:47: to another mod pack I don't want to like
04:25:50: I don't want to just completely
04:25:52: transition into a Minecraft streamer as
04:25:53: much as I want to do
04:25:57: that I to playing some regular games I'm
04:26:00: not
04:26:06: uh
04:26:08: I'll take a break and then I'll go into
04:26:11: another mod pack how does that
04:26:13: sound how did that
04:26:22: sound have I close the game yet my guys
04:26:22: I'm closing in what is what is the what
04:26:25: is the button to like check uh the to
04:26:30: check how many hours youve put into the
04:26:34: game all right so statistics here we
04:26:37: go it's not over yet there's still like
04:26:40: two is streams to
04:26:43: go I've flown 103
04:26:45: km I've flown more than I've sprinted or
04:26:49: swam uh sprinted yeah I've flown more
04:26:53: than I
04:26:55: sprinted I've dealt 23,000 damage I love
04:26:59: numbers I've taken 56 5 5600
04:27:04: damage
04:27:07: I've quit the game 32
04:27:20: this time since last rest 10
04:27:20: minutes time play 3.34
04:27:25: days so that's 24 by
04:27:29: 3 it's like 80
04:27:37: hours
04:27:37: it's actually not that bad I I mean
04:27:40: technically have raids one
04:27:49: Z zero raids one in 3 days and 80 hours
04:27:53: of game
04:28:01: play yeah this is like nothing this is
04:28:01: actually rookie
04:28:07: numbers it's cuz I only ever play on
04:28:07: stream if I if I if I could play this
04:28:10: off stream I'd be 80 hours in like a
04:28:19: week yeah see I'm such a reasonable
04:28:19: gamer I'm not I'm not a Serial time
04:28:23: waster I'm not a Serial
04:28:29: Miner look I know I know some people
04:28:32: have done like hundreds of episodes of
04:28:35: Minecraft C I've watched them all all
04:28:47: right I'm sorry I'm a filthy casual I
04:28:47: would I would ah I would have more hours
04:28:50: if maybe I I don't know I think I think
04:28:54: maybe I should slow down next time so
04:28:56: people can play with me I feel like I
04:28:58: feel like people don't play the game
04:29:01: because I've just gone too far and like
04:29:04: it's kind of difficult to catch up with
04:29:07: somebody who plays all the time all day
04:29:10: every day and like not leave any room
04:29:14: for
04:29:15: learning so I feel I feel kind of bad
04:29:18: about that and like I
04:29:22: don't I don't know maybe next time maybe
04:29:24: next time I play I'll play on a single
04:29:26: player world or if it's a if it's a
04:29:28: group Minecraft session and I'll play
04:29:30: Slow
04:29:31: slower I was too sweaty yeah maybe
04:29:34: that's it
04:29:36: but yeah you're play power world man
04:29:39: power world sucks I mean it doesn't suck
04:29:43: but honestly power world is like you
04:29:45: play like 12 hours of a straight and
04:29:47: then you're done and it's just done you
04:29:53: know I think it's I don't think it's
04:29:53: power world I think it's me I I feel I
04:29:56: feel like
04:29:57: bad cuz cuz I I would be pretty upset if
04:30:00: somebody was like a super sweaty gamer
