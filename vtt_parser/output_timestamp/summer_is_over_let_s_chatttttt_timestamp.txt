00:25:04: we learned it was awful it sucked I
00:25:09: didn't have
00:25:11: fun how many students survive this Camp
00:25:14: I they were werewolves and
00:25:16: everything how CH was doing thisy thank
00:25:19: you this is so the first time I super do
00:25:22: you still have nightmares about the
00:25:24: grass I don't know I didn't really
00:25:27: interact with anybody I wasn't like an
00:25:28: all girls DM so it wasn't that
00:25:31: bad jealous archery sees in my area but
00:25:34: those cowardly deer don't get close to
00:25:36: me unfortunately I want to shoot a deer
00:25:40: with a bow and arrow that sounds so
00:25:42: cool that sounds so
00:25:45: cool that's so cool you know how to
00:25:47: interact with girls no I didn't interact
00:25:49: with
00:25:51: anybody man it was so I remember like
00:25:54: being all emo and stuff and going out in
00:25:56: the middle of the night and just like
00:25:57: looking at the star cars cuz I I
00:25:59: couldn't sleep in that in this in this
00:26:02: stupid stupid
00:26:08: dorm thank God I survived the labor I
00:26:08: mean summer camp how what did you guys
00:26:11: think about face summer camp I think a
00:26:13: crossbow suits you better than a bow but
00:26:15: it's so cool to like aim a bow don't you
00:26:17: think you're too small to hold a deer
00:26:20: gun
00:26:22: no
00:26:24: no I'll put on the ground like a sniper
00:26:26: rifle
00:26:28: do you see any shooting stars no but it
00:26:31: was really beautiful because I don't
00:26:33: it's it's like A Place With No Light
00:26:40: pollution you can use a bow I've I've
00:26:40: tried like shooting stuff before I've
00:26:42: tried like um I've tried holding a bow
00:26:44: and arrow before I think it would be
00:26:47: really cool I think it's really cool I
00:26:50: do think that if I were to pick up like
00:26:53: a sport of some sort I think it would be
00:26:55: you know the bow the bow bow it was a
00:26:59: recur no it was a regular
00:27:02: bow yeah and every time I'm finished my
00:27:04: arm like my like my left arm the one
00:27:08: holding the bow would like
00:27:11: be would be a noodle for the rest of
00:27:14: like the next two
00:27:16: days Sumer Camp was a blast a yay I'm

00:29:33: if you're interested if you are then I
00:29:35: can Yap about it let's let me let me
00:29:38: show you the project
00:29:41: file hi run a through process like from
00:29:44: the very beginning when when I decided
00:29:46: to talk about
00:29:57: this so like um when I first thought
00:29:57: about about the project we had to do two
00:29:59: two summer
00:30:01: songs and my summer song was going to be
00:30:04: with
00:30:05: um with a nine oh god what the heck is
00:30:09: this
00:30:15: layout is darts it's too big to shoot
00:30:15: Bears
00:30:17: Kuma Kuma Kuma from
00:30:21: T dozy said you were the monkey Queen
00:30:25: what what what do you mean was a monkey
00:30:28: Queen yeah this is the demo project file
00:30:32: I have like a demo for the song this is
00:30:34: this is it I should probably like make
00:30:36: this a bit less ugly it's really
00:30:40: ugly it's really ugly Jesus we have like
00:30:43: a couple of drafts of
00:30:45: this where all the tracks purple what
00:30:48: the heck I can change the color for you
00:30:49: it fades into blue look it fades in a
00:30:54: blue yeah um so basically I had to do a
00:30:57: demo for
00:30:58: everybody uh to sing and stuff um I
00:31:02: think I have my recordings as well in a
00:31:05: different project file but this is the
00:31:07: demo uh so basically what happened
00:31:11: knowing it's ugly in publishing anyways
00:31:14: no this is not it's just the the the
00:31:16: organization that's bad okay this is
00:31:18: just a bad it's just bad
00:31:21: organization the Pico rap was crazy yeah
00:31:24: it I I it was like a oh my God I can
00:31:27: show you that project follow the one I
00:31:29: sent P it was really cringe I don't know
00:31:31: if I want to say I don't know I want to
00:31:33: send
00:31:38: it oh my
00:31:41: God
00:31:43: anyways anyways anyways uh no I wasn't I
00:31:47: wasn't doing it in Japanese I was like
00:31:49: doing it
00:31:50: like yeah it I didn't think she would
00:31:53: follow it that that closely but
00:31:55: basically what I did was like da da da
00:32:00: da I did stuff like that and I was like
00:32:03: can you write in a section I didn't
00:32:04: think she would like actually like
00:32:05: follow the exact
00:32:07: like the exact um Rhythm for it and even
00:32:12: the intonation of
00:32:15: it oh my God okay so basically let me
00:32:18: just run through it from run run you
00:32:20: through the process from the very
00:32:22: beginning so for the very
00:32:25: beginning I think s's going to kill me
00:32:27: if she knows that I if if if she knew I
00:32:32: uh if I if if she if she if if she if if
00:32:38: if she where where are the files if if
00:32:43: she knew
00:32:45: I sent if I showed all the whips of
00:32:50: this she doesn't have to know we have
00:32:53: summer eight and we have summer nine and
00:32:56: we have summer seven
00:32:58: look these are all these are some whips
00:33:00: I think there's like earlier ones but
00:33:02: basically
00:33:03: um I wanted to do something
00:33:07: like Katy Perry's
00:33:13: fireworks it was like a Katy Perry song
00:33:13: I was like can you C copy like this Katy
00:33:15: Perry song cuz I think it would work
00:33:17: really well for
00:33:26: summer like the first draft like the the
00:33:26: court progression was kind of off so
00:33:27: like hey can you like copy this Katy
00:33:29: Perry song
00:33:32: instead cuz I cuz I thought it would be
00:33:34: really suitable for like a summer song
00:33:37: you know and she was like okay yeah laow
00:33:40: got
00:33:45: it and and yeah yeah I thought it turned
00:33:48: out pretty well like let me let me show
00:33:50: you some of the
00:33:53: stuff here I think this was the first
00:33:56: one this is all
00:33:59: similar this basically the same I
00:34:08: think yeah this is basically the same
00:34:08: it's I mean I just said use Katy Perry
00:34:10: as an inspiration you
00:34:27: progression um first I had a little bit
00:34:27: of trouble like writing the chorus I
00:34:29: have I have like a very early draft of
00:34:32: um what I wrote for the chorus it was
00:34:34: basically like demo
00:34:37: a but yeah um this time when I wrote the
00:34:41: song uh when when we wrote the song I
00:34:44: started with the title of the song I I
00:34:47: really wanted it to be um endless Sunset
00:34:51: and like the the whole the whole um
00:34:54: theme of the song I had like a little
00:34:56: little blur for it I was it was
00:34:58: something like
00:35:00: uh
00:35:02: um what what was it again what was it
00:35:11: again what was it again what was it
00:35:11: again let me look in my
00:35:14: DMs endless
00:35:16: Sunset yeah um me
00:35:24: see yeah it was
00:35:24: like yeah if this is the last Sunset
00:35:27: then that will'll ever have together
00:35:29: then I'm praying that it'll never end
00:35:31: that was like the first that was like
00:35:33: the first basic basic blurb of what I
00:35:36: want the song to feel like
00:35:39: mhm it's like yeah it's like wanting to
00:35:42: be with your friends forever how sappy
00:35:45: yeah I mean I mean when you write songs
00:35:48: you got to make it sappy okay morbid she
00:35:51: named an endless D that's a horrible
00:35:55: name yeah so anyways the first drap was
00:35:58: like this it was
00:36:06: like as a day fad away we're together
00:36:06: like this there's a feeling in the back
00:36:09: of my mind let me let me look for it
00:36:11: actually it was the first draft and I
00:36:14: didn't really like it so I rewrote it to
00:36:18: I rewrote the entire
00:36:20: course I think during this part during
00:36:23: like this entire writing section we were
00:36:26: actually pretty pretty good on time like
00:36:29: uh we worked on this really early but
00:36:31: then the crunch got really bad near the
00:36:33: end cuz deadlines were being missed and
00:36:37: like people are getting sick and
00:36:38: everything so we couldn't really get
00:36:40: anything in on
00:36:43: time okay let me where is it where did I
00:36:48: where did I put this where did I put
00:36:50: this face
00:36:56: connect
00:36:56: aha um
00:36:58: endless sumwhere
00:37:25: the yeah you know don't pretend you this
00:37:25: was 10
00:37:33: yeah that that was the tar ra and then
00:37:34: here's the early Top Line draft I
00:37:41: think don't laugh don't laugh don't
00:37:41: laugh at
00:37:50: me whatever whatever okay whatever okay
00:37:50: whatever whatever
00:37:58: no this was the first round I think like
00:37:58: the first ever draft I think the first
00:38:01: verse was really good so I didn't really
00:38:03: change
00:38:11: it uh I think it starts
00:38:13: here shaking me to the car if I fall
00:38:18: into the sand I want to play together
00:38:22: every day the time we have is way too
00:38:26: short to get it
00:38:28: take my head I got a feeling that we're
00:38:31: going to slow down cuz I want to
00:38:34: together always face can't end this
00:38:38: way catch the ball in your hands my way
00:38:41: ofing I
00:38:48: love this was the first draft this
00:38:52: there's a feeling in the back of my
00:38:55: mind I day every day has been nothing
00:39:00: but place so I don't want it to end
00:39:05: this so listen to me baby let make never
00:39:09: so
00:39:11: Unforgettable is part all again if this
00:39:16: is the last Dan that we'll have together
00:39:19: here and oh I and never ever end
00:39:27: why is it not like mixed man why is it
00:39:30: like just
00:39:47: raw and this is like a copy paste cuz I
00:39:47: was cuz I wanted to like get the um
00:39:50: structure
00:39:52: right catch the ball in your hands my
00:39:55: way of staying I love
00:40:03: so yeah that's that's it that's that's
00:40:03: basically it and then I and then I had
00:40:05: like this little epiphan I was like
00:40:07: having this like whole like meltdown I
00:40:08: was like oh my god dude this chor sucks
00:40:10: it's not catchy it's like it doesn't
00:40:13: flow properly like it doesn't there's no
00:40:16: like upbeat and there's like it's like
00:40:18: it's like cooked and I was like I think
00:40:20: I can probably do better and then like
00:40:22: as I wrote the current one I was like
00:40:23: but I like the second part of the first
00:40:25: chorus more but I was like oh but I want
00:40:27: to give everybody like some lines that's
00:40:29: not just that's not just like the um
00:40:32: that's not just their solo lines and um
00:40:36: so I was like what if we had like this
00:40:38: this little section when everybody is
00:40:39: like going like uh everybody's saying
00:40:42: their own lines and like since there's
00:40:45: like nine people right we can do like
00:40:47: one one one one one and then two people
00:40:49: will share one one bar and then that'll
00:40:52: be nine um versus it it was the same it
00:40:55: was the same feeling it was the same
00:40:56: thing I I I shared when I um we were
00:40:58: apping the structure of the song we were
00:41:00: like this this person one bar one bar
00:41:03: one bar one bar so that's four bars
00:41:05: before each chor uh four sections before
00:41:08: each chorus and then another four
00:41:09: sections before the chorus and then one
00:41:12: bridge to fill in that nin person for
00:41:16: that ninth person one Bridge before the
00:41:17: um final course and stuff that they Shar

00:45:27: I haven't listened to this in a
00:45:45: while why is it in my left ear yeah
00:45:45: anyways I think the last course I think
00:45:48: Amy really killed it in the last course
00:45:51: it was like crazy like the belt she did
00:45:54: was insane I could not
00:46:00: yeah this was the demo I sent them
00:46:12: basically yeah that that was a demo
00:46:12: that's that's the entire demo um
00:46:15: basically what I did was I wrote this
00:46:17: part first I think I had a good idea for
00:46:20: the for the first versus
00:46:24: um a pretty fast part for the pre pre
00:46:28: chorus I think I think this was
00:46:30: basically set in stone the moment I
00:46:32: wrote it and for the chorus I was kind
00:46:34: of debating but after like um for for
00:46:37: this part it could have been uh could
00:46:39: have been different you know like it
00:46:42: could have been
00:46:44: like I could have not had this and I
00:46:46: could have had the first version instead
00:46:48: which was how did it go again uh uh how
00:46:52: did it go again I have the lyrics here
00:47:02: oh like this there's a feeling in the
00:47:05: back of my
00:47:07: mind I want to say every day has been
00:47:11: nothing but bliss but I don't want to
00:47:15: end this
00:47:17: time yeah but it doesn't flow very well
00:47:20: right you would think it would think the
00:47:22: next part it goes like like listen to me
00:47:25: baby let's make me
00:47:27: so
00:47:29: Unforgettable us about it all again I I
00:47:33: think that's a good like Melody but I
00:47:35: don't know where to fit it you know I I
00:47:37: think no it doesn't really flow I don't
00:47:40: think you know I think I think the
00:47:42: second verse was I think the second
00:47:44: verse had a pretty good like Melody
00:47:45: going but like it it went like it had a
00:47:48: good Rhythm and it had like uh not not
00:47:50: not like a melody that's not jump
00:47:52: doesn't jump too much so it could have
00:47:54: had the potential to be catchy but what
00:47:56: do I know
00:48:00: I think this the I think this the best I
00:48:01: could have done yeah I think having this
00:48:04: cute part was very important I
00:48:11: think yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
00:48:11: thank
00:48:13: you yeah and oh my God let me play this
00:48:17: so when's the jelly solo MV coming out I
00:48:20: was thinking of doing solo covers of the
00:48:22: songs that I wrote like um forgot the
00:48:25: names write the future
00:48:30: I've think I've been thinking of doing
00:48:30: those but I've never really gotten
00:48:31: around to it um anyways wait I want to
00:48:35: show you the the actual like version Let
00:48:37: me let me just open this on
00:48:50: YouTube what Amy Leon meiru meu's not
00:48:53: here what are you talking about
00:49:00: oh after ex carefully examining
00:49:00: everything clearly they have something
00:49:01: that the rest of you don't I mean the
00:49:02: chest Department um we separated it
00:49:07: based on like
00:49:09: um we separated it based on basically
00:49:12: like like basically like Vibes you know
00:49:14: like like pico would sing a cute song
00:49:17: like a pop upbeat song um Amy would also
00:49:20: sing also has like a more upbeat vibe to
00:49:23: her like to like her
00:49:25: character and like
00:49:28: huh Hina what happened
00:49:37: there I don't remember actually but that
00:49:37: was I'm not I don't really remember I
00:49:40: should to
00:49:42: remember did I miss something I think I
00:49:44: missed something Leah was padding no
00:49:45: Leah was cute Leah's
00:49:49: cute no Pico's basically like this part
00:49:52: like the part the breakdown part here
00:50:00: like this part was always going to be a
00:50:00: rap part it was um I think every I think
00:50:04: I wrote a lot of the lines without
00:50:06: really thinking about who to assign them
00:50:08: to cuz I don't really want to assign
00:50:10: people to stuff cuz maybe they don't
00:50:12: like that part especially like around
00:50:14: this part the the
00:50:18: basically the only things I've assigned
00:50:21: is tma's rap and Pico's rap and
00:50:25: then cuz I think having like a Japanese
00:50:27: section flow in in the middle it would
00:50:29: be really cool
00:50:34: um uh this part what the heck is going
00:50:36: on outside I hear I hear I I hear I hear
00:50:40: an
00:50:47: ambulance do you hear
00:50:47: that I hear an
00:50:50: ambulance anyways the only Parts I
00:50:53: assigned I had people in mind when I
00:50:55: wrote this but I didn't really assign
00:50:58: them I didn't assign any of these parts
00:51:01: these first three I assigned this one to
00:51:03: myself because of the ball I when I saw
00:51:06: the art I I don't know why but I
00:51:09: misremembered it and I was like oh yeah
00:51:11: Remy is holding the ball right so I I
00:51:13: actually wrote this for Remy but then I
00:51:16: but then I checked the art again and it
00:51:18: was actually me holding the ball so I
00:51:19: just gave Remy the second
00:51:25: section is in my
00:51:28: head there's an ambulance going on
00:51:31: there's an ambulance
00:51:33: outside um I I did I did these two parts
00:51:37: for Pico and
00:51:39: Tenma I I gave the hungry one to Moo to
00:51:43: Moo
00:51:45: you a little hungry moo it was actually
00:51:48: supposed to be me but I thought muu
00:51:50: being hungry would be really
00:51:53: cute um I think the bikini l was always
00:51:57: going to be hena's or Amy's it was one
00:52:00: of
00:52:01: it
00:52:15: else enough let's make some baby take
00:52:15: some P by the barbecue maybe getting a
00:52:18: little hungry water's a little too cold
00:52:21: for me it's a it'sit too tight in this
00:52:23: bikini could you help me with my sun
00:52:31: I guess the only lines that are hard to
00:52:31: sign were the PCO lines cuz I don't
00:52:34: really write well in Japanese like my
00:52:36: grammar is kind of kind of bingus you
00:52:38: know the the ooh barbecue line like the
00:52:42: one the one on my summer summer
00:52:47: promo I had like a really I I drew like
00:52:50: a little section for everybody as well
00:52:52: when I like wrote the lines for based on
00:52:55: the second part the verse then you came
00:52:58: five months assigning lines based on the
00:53:01: art is
00:53:03: crazy I didn't I didn't assign that I
00:53:05: didn't assign that much I basically had
00:53:07: like some roles in in in mind like um we
00:53:12: have like somebody who's scared of the
00:53:13: water we have somebody who's um playful
00:53:17: somebody who's like who who has a tight
00:53:26: bik and stuff you know

01:18:29: yeah sure it's going to crash my
01:18:31: computer but I'll
01:18:34: try yeah it was okay I enjoy the energy
01:18:36: of the new one me too I think the new
01:18:38: one's got the catchy Vibe I wanted to
01:18:41: I've always wanted to
01:18:42: write yeah you're you're getting
01:18:44: exclusive listens of scrapped drafts
01:18:48: never to be heard ever
01:18:51: again anyways I was talking about this
01:18:54: right
01:19:01: look at my
01:19:16: layers nobody hears this nobody hears
01:19:16: this
01:19:26: nobody hears
01:19:29: this nobody hears that not many people
01:19:32: hear this but nobody hears that low
01:19:35: nobody hears this but if I don't have it
01:19:37: it sounds bad
01:19:54: why is it only in the left
01:20:01: ear I think I got too lazy to do to
01:20:01: record the right ear
01:20:11: version than you for the 14 months nice
01:20:14: forehead thank
01:20:32: way nobody hears that nobody hears this
01:20:32: either nobody hears this
01:20:39: either what program you use I use FL to
01:20:39: mix and I use uh here are my
01:20:43: plugins here are my plugins I have all
01:20:46: of these oh it's not it's not I just
01:20:49: realized it's not been tracking my my
01:20:52: mouse oh my God start tracking my
01:21:03: mouse I've got all of these all of these
01:21:03: yeah I don't hear those yeah I didn't
01:21:05: like it I didn't like it if it stood out
01:21:06: like if it stands
01:21:12: out this one this one is this one
01:21:13: doesn't is this one pretty it's it's not
01:21:15: that inaudible this one is
01:21:19: inaudible it's kind of there but it's
01:21:21: not like if I made it
01:21:23: louder it kind of clashes so it just
01:21:25: made it really soft I'm not I've never
01:21:28: been very good at ad
01:21:37: living now if Amy was here that' be a
01:21:40: different
01:21:51: story I like this part
01:22:01: I think some of the layered bits get
01:22:01: lost to compression from being uploaded
01:22:03: to YouTube and other streaming sites
01:22:05: yeah that makes sense I mean whatever I
01:22:07: listen to most music in my car so it's

01:30:10: at each look at each
01:30:19: layer I don't I I do take criticism
01:30:19: because I don't play the piano
01:30:25: this is a rose I
01:30:27: think should have may made that like one
01:30:30: octave
01:30:37: lower got some uh layering here I do not
01:30:37: play the piano I do not I do not I have
01:30:40: some I have some I spammed like wind
01:30:42: chimes here cuz I thought it would be
01:30:49: funny it's like 50 million different
01:30:49: wind chimes cuz it it it needed
01:30:51: something but I didn't know what it
01:30:52: needed so I just dumped buch of wi
01:30:54: Chimes also I I didn't have like a ton
01:30:57: of time to work on
01:31:03: this but I think it's all right I like I
01:31:03: like crunched like a seconding amount of
01:31:07: time hi jelly did you use uh whoa I'm
01:31:11: not saying that
01:31:32: part I feel like I I wanted like a very
01:31:32: particular guitar sound but I couldn't
01:31:34: really find it also this is without any
01:31:37: um EQ cuz I I had to use the suoth to EQ
01:31:40: to make this not sound like garbage but
01:31:44: uh too
01:31:45: bad almost got her no there was no way
01:31:49: it was in no way almost it was it was
01:31:51: not even close baby it was it was not
01:31:55: even close baby
01:32:30: I I guess I like the melody for this
01:32:30: song I I really quite liked
01:32:51: violin I was like harmonizing with it a
01:32:51: little bit
01:33:03: okay but the real question is where is
01:33:03: the jacked AR I think it was this one no
01:33:06: this is like this is like Jack
01:33:09: guitar it was this one I
01:33:11: think this has to be the Jack yeah this
01:33:13: is the jack darp why is it called why is
01:33:15: it name the
01:33:19: jackar should have used the melody for

01:33:24: months why is this called the jacked
01:33:35: ARP why is this called the Jack why is
01:33:35: this why is this called
01:33:46: nah what why is this called
01:33:52: N I know what it's called called nah it
01:33:54: kind of
01:33:56: sucks it's kind of be like kind of like
01:33:58: a swell if you know what I mean
01:34:11: nah yeah the violence are just layering
01:34:11: I really don't like how they
01:34:20: sound I like two different V layers of
01:34:23: my insane
01:34:24: oh yeah was cuz Sak kept going like we
01:34:26: need more strings we need to sound like
01:34:28: the song and then I was like okay
01:34:30: strings okay I don't have very good
01:34:32: string libraries but
01:34:35: okay and we have this what's
01:34:56: nah this is on named sad I would have
01:34:56: named it something
01:34:57: funny but yeah I think that's it I got
01:35:00: the wind chimes going insane again near
01:35:03: the
01:35:04: end oh God we got
01:35:08: the key
01:35:16: change
01:35:16: mhm man I really want to like write a
01:35:19: song that's not this soy this this soy
01:35:24: this the soy guitar violin
01:35:29: piano stuff you know I I wish I wish I
01:35:33: could write something more in the genre
01:35:35: I usually write in because this is not
01:35:37: this used to be my expertise but it's
01:35:40: not really anymore I've been
01:35:42: experimenting a lot more with other
01:35:45: things but man sound like Sims Music
01:35:48: what the
01:35:50: heck what the heck man
01:35:58: isn't this soy this is like Peak soy
01:35:58: dude I like wrote this and it was like
01:36:00: it was like oh my guys
01:36:02: soy this is so
01:36:06: soy how is it not soy it's so soy it's
01:36:09: so soy it's even
01:36:18: lagging oh my God it's so soy yeah it's
01:36:18: kind of like anime ending music thank
01:36:20: you kimchi for the seven months heavy
01:36:23: metal jelly went I can't I can't there's
01:36:26: a lot of things that I can't really
01:36:29: replicate perfectly like if I could play
01:36:31: the guitar the song would be a lot
01:36:33: better if I could properly play the
01:36:35: piano the song would be a lot better
01:36:36: this just sounds like I'm trying to
01:36:39: write something but it just sounds too
01:36:43: electronic you know so I had to like add
01:36:46: some electronic butts so it sounds like
01:36:47: it's meant to be like that and I just
01:36:49: try to like bury everything in the
01:36:51: vocals cuz the instrumental itself
01:36:52: sounds kind of
01:36:54: but like with the vocals I guess it's
01:36:56: you know less it it it focus is a lot
01:36:59: less in the
01:37:12: tear through
01:37:12: everything it's always been
01:37:17: TR so won't you
01:37:20: stay another day
01:37:32: will meet again same time and I'm not
01:37:32: very good at writing this kind of lyrics
01:37:35: I'm not very good at this I'm going to
01:37:36: be completely honest I like how this
01:37:39: sounds but I was tearing my hair out

01:49:17: anything like this ever again I think I
01:49:19: really went out of my way for this one
01:49:29: I don't think I've ever been this
01:49:30: creative in my life and then I'm just uh
01:49:31: burnt out now
01:49:37: so I feel like this could could have a
01:49:37: little a better transition but I I don't
01:49:39: know I think I think it's I think it's
01:49:41: good enough for like a background music
01:49:43: you
01:49:44: know let me let me look at the layers
01:49:47: I'm
01:49:54: interested why did I
01:49:54: why is this why is this all in one track
01:49:58: why is this all in one
01:50:01: track that's 1 2 three 4 that's four
01:50:06: patterns in one track am I insane why
01:50:09: did I do
01:50:21: that what's wrong with that it means I
01:50:21: can't look at each one and and like uh
01:50:25: uh what is that word uh solo each
01:50:28: instrument like from the pattern roll
01:50:32: thing what are you using to edit this is

01:50:42: I do this all the time like I I do this
01:50:45: delay by three and then I use this exact
01:50:48: instrument every single time
01:50:58: I also do this a
01:50:58: lot I isolate I isolate a word I also do
01:51:01: this a lot
01:51:32: interesting oh I did vocalize for
01:51:35: this then I turned I turned off the
01:51:39: um effect for this
01:51:54: bit yeah that's it I'll just mute it
01:51:54: because it doesn't really add much that
01:51:57: I care much
01:52:07: for yeah that's all it's for interesting
01:52:07: harmonies oh it wasn't it's not actually
01:52:09: harmonies look at this look at this look

01:54:49: good mic for it
01:55:04: this is as close to artcore as I'm ever
01:55:04: going to
01:55:09: get this this this this part this part
01:55:12: I'm pretty sure I heard it somewhere
01:55:15: before can somebody tell me where they
01:55:17: heard this exact motive before this this
01:55:21: this I stole this from somewhere I stole
01:55:23: this from somewhere I don't remember
01:55:25: where it was from here I really like the
01:55:27: piano I did
01:55:31: this what genre do you usually make
01:55:43: music that that that that that thing
01:55:43: I've heard it before I've heard it
01:55:46: before is it is it too I remember I
01:55:50: remember I I stole it from my mind I
01:55:53: didn't like steal it steal it I didn't
01:55:55: like will I didn't like knowingly steal
01:55:57: it it's just that I know I've heard it
01:55:58: before and it's a good it's a good one
01:56:01: it's too are you
01:56:02: sure no I don't think it's too I think
01:56:05: it's something
01:56:07: else is it actually too no it's
01:56:09: something else it's got to be something
01:56:11: else
01:56:13: dude it's driving me insane it's driv me
01:56:16: insane it's driv me
01:56:19: insane oh my God I don't know but I I
01:56:22: like the piano I did over
01:56:28: here what does this even sound like
01:56:40: Jesus this one I also heard I've also
01:56:42: heard this before
01:56:57: it's the piano player the Chinese
01:56:57: restaurant I don't play the piano I
01:56:59: don't even know how be do
01:57:08: this yeah it's the same one but this one
01:57:11: has like the ending so
01:57:15: yeah I mean this it's not that hard to
01:57:18: like to like pretend to know how to play
01:57:20: piano just do this
01:57:22: like you know what I do for the piano
01:57:24: usually I would like put something
01:57:26: down and then I would
01:57:33: like I would like do this and be like Oh
01:57:33: yeah this is this is a good chord right
01:57:35: oh my god let's go and I'll be
01:57:47: like it I would just do that I would
01:57:47: just cut it and then it it would like
01:57:49: work somehow
01:57:56: I've always wanted to make
01:57:56: artcore I've always wanted to make
01:58:00: artcore
01:58:02: yeah yeah and that's what I do all the
01:58:05: time that's why my piano sounds so
01:58:11: bad I don't know what the heck I was on
01:58:14: when I did this I don't I seriously do
01:58:16: not know what I was
01:58:17: on like I don't think I could ever do
01:58:20: this again
01:58:22: oh well let's go into my
01:58:24: portfolio cuz I'm pretty sure like 90%
01:58:27: of you who like who are in the Stream

01:58:40: little bit you know like some
01:58:43: Melodies this is like the kind of stuff
01:58:46: I would make well
01:58:47: High I've heard it in the walls

02:00:56: listen to my
02:01:26: Fade Out is pretty important which VST
02:01:26: is that
02:01:34: this it's probably some contact
02:01:34: thing it's
02:01:39: F it's a flute from contact Factory
02:02:02: Library it's clarinet from
02:02:02: cont
02:02:12: it's it's GL it's SP from contact
02:02:12: Factory it's a stock sound it's a stock
02:02:16: sound it's a stock orchestral sound it's
02:02:30: Stu it comes with contact it's
02:02:30: Stu you're right it does sound pretty
02:02:42: good it's stock man stock it's like the
02:02:42: it's like the free one they give you for
02:02:43: free cuz I don't I don't have anything
02:02:45: that I want to
02:02:49: buy I love stock sounds man I like use
02:02:52: stock sounds all the time like this
02:02:54: entire thing might as well be made from
02:02:55: stock
02:03:02: sounds is this stock sound okay no this
02:03:02: is Cinematic
02:03:21: one okay it's cinematic strings what
02:03:21: about this one ooh my double base this
02:03:25: is probably also cinematic
02:03:31: strings throw in some violent playing
02:03:33: from Ura oh this was also crunch time so
02:03:35: I couldn't ask her to like play uh play
02:03:39: it uh cuz cuz it would be cruel of me to
02:03:42: do that there's also cinematic strs Stu
02:03:45: this is not this is not stock this is
02:03:48: bot this is also probably not bot I mean
02:03:52: this is also probably
02:03:58: bought
02:03:58: CBR
02:04:03: yeah probably also cinematic C strings
02:04:07: actually I'm too La
02:04:15: check yeah
02:04:19: yeah yeah I like this song I think it's
02:04:22: I think it's actually pretty good I
02:04:24: think it's pretty good I had some
02:04:27: trouble starting it because it had to be
02:04:29: 1 minute around one
02:04:32: minute I like it yeah thank you I wanted
02:04:36: to show this for a while now never
02:04:38: really found the time to but yeah this
02:04:40: is the stuff I've made for face connect
02:04:43: I can I'll show you maybe the tallenge
02:04:45: um bgm someday like the faas radio bgm
02:04:49: sheena's bgm disease star starting dis
02:04:52: bgm I don't think it's starting it's dis
02:04:55: bgm
02:04:57: um yeah my
02:05:00: own I can't be this creative ever again
02:05:03: no it's it's literally
02:05:15: machine but yeah I always think that
02:05:15: watching somebody make music or like
02:05:17: watching somebody stream how they make
02:05:20: music is a very ful way of learning how
02:05:25: uh how how to make music and how music's
02:05:28: made I've been curious how you made disy
02:05:30: intro screens since
02:05:32: deut deut I can show you next
02:05:36: time could you watch Robert
02:05:39: porterson yeah
02:05:42: anyways yeah I think how did this song
02:05:45: start again I know that the previous
02:05:47: song The Euphoria song I was given like
02:05:50: a a very hard reference for that and it
02:05:54: was actually pretty fun to like learn
02:05:57: how to make a song that exciting cuz
02:06:00: I've never made a song that exciting
02:06:02: before so yeah I think this one I'm a
02:06:05: lot more used to making orchestral stuff
02:06:08: because coming from an
02:06:10: Orchestra Orchestra or like quartet
02:06:12: background it's a bit easier for me to
02:06:15: like um think of how to do things like
02:06:18: this like
02:06:24: like this part I guess
02:06:26: uh this is basically the flute solo
02:06:29: section right and then we have like a a
02:06:32: call and answer part over
02:06:38: here this is a call from the violin and
02:06:42: then we have an answer from the flute so
02:06:45: basically how songs are structured I
02:06:48: think especially for orchestra things I
02:06:51: have been taught a lot about um this
02:06:54: thing called call and call Ann answer
02:06:57: where basically it's like a part that is
02:07:01: like a
02:07:03: question and then there's an answer from
02:07:06: like a different part it makes the St a
02:07:08: little more
02:07:14: interesting I always try to do that in
02:07:14: my music call in response whatever man
02:07:16: something like that yeah call and
02:07:17: response yeah that thing um I guess
02:07:21: that's one of the things I've learned
02:07:23: during uh my quartets my my experience
02:07:27: with string
02:07:28: instruments yeah it's a very good
02:07:31: feature question and answer yeah
02:07:33: something like that it's used a lot in
02:07:35: like um classical music a lot of Duets I
02:07:40: played with my teacher and stuff metal
02:07:43: does that a lot that's awesome I think
02:07:46: everybody does everything does that a
02:07:49: lot yeah I think it's I think it's a
02:07:51: very cool thing to to

02:12:10: has
02:12:13: numbers thank you thank you and I I
02:12:17: don't know I think crunching in the end
02:12:19: is is is worth it
02:12:22: well no it's really not I I would
02:12:24: honestly prefer to not crunch so hard
02:12:26: I'd prefer to not have to render a video
02:12:28: on
02:12:34: stream but you know but you know but you
02:12:38: know
02:12:42: whatever you know it's fine it's all
02:12:46: good I'm going to eat my hands
02:12:58: oh wow oh wow oh wow oh
02:12:58: wow having F1 to F12 was nice and all
02:13:01: but what about f-13 to f24 they should
02:13:04: really have a second row of function
02:13:07: keys that' be really
02:13:10: funny that' be great that was funny not
02:13:13: going to lie what what mean rendering a
02:13:15: video in the middle of a collab you know
02:13:29: I want to play
02:13:30: games I want to play games there are key
02:13:33: codes for F1 to f24 but nobody makes
02:13:35: keyboards of them anymore
02:13:42: why man that's like another 12 macrobes
02:13:42: you can set up whoever removed f-13 to
02:13:45: f24 was a fool they thought they thought
02:13:49: they couldn't they thought we didn't
02:13:50: need those 12 function keys but nowadays
02:13:54: we have returned
02:14:01: to needing those function keys just
02:14:01: kidding we don't actually need that many
02:14:03: function keys but having those function
02:14:05: keys would be really
02:14:10: funny larger Tech G keyboards notably
02:14:13: the g15 has 18 extra function keys I
02:14:17: have not built a keyboard with my jelly

02:17:31: silent lers I um I was using uh
02:17:36: different kind of Silence I was I was
02:17:40: using uh was I used to be really into
02:17:45: linear I had like a really good setup
02:17:48: but then the base kind of crapped out on
02:17:50: me so I need to find a new frosted
02:17:52: acrylic
02:17:56: base what the heck is a clicky it's the
02:17:59: ones that sound disgusting it's the ones

02:18:23: honest I'm kind of getting into tactiles
02:18:25: I think linear are cool because they

02:18:56: drawer somewhere I have a silenti one
02:19:01: that uses jelly Palms the ones with that
02:19:04: are engraved on the
02:19:06: side are engraved on the sides so like
02:19:09: the top of the keyboard is like clear
02:19:12: like this exact same one also it has a
02:19:15: frost base so it looks really good it
02:19:18: looks like edible
02:19:21: but then the base crapped out so I'm
02:19:24: cooked now I'm cooked I can't use it
02:19:27: anymore because sometimes I would be
02:19:29: typing and then one of the keys would
02:19:32: like hang you know like I'll be like
02:19:35: like typing something like um yes and
02:19:37: then the S would like stick and it would
02:19:39: go
