02:06:07 -> 02:06:08:  And to form a connection with them. (-0.3058054368574541)

02:06:56 -> 02:06:56:  And... (-0.38278806007514565)
02:06:57 -> 02:07:00:  And saying you guys should probably be friends with each other. (-0.38278806007514565)
02:07:00 -> 02:07:02:  Because...  You guys are similar. (-0.38278806007514565)

02:11:36 -> 02:11:37:  I'll just move on with my day. (-0.2252435364179163)

02:39:21 -> 02:39:24:  In social situations, I'm probably closer to being... (-0.4249609289034991)
02:39:33 -> 02:39:37:  You sometimes keep old plane and movie tickets as memorabilia. (-0.4249609289034991)
02:39:40 -> 02:39:41:  Sometimes...  No. (-0.4249609289034991)
02:39:41 -> 02:39:42:  What the heck? (-0.4249609289034991)

02:40:11 -> 02:40:12:  But then again, who does? (-0.4575394850510817)
02:40:12 -> 02:40:14:  It's not something that's worth getting upset over. (-0.4575394850510817)
02:40:14 -> 02:40:14:  Okay. (-0.4575394850510817)
02:40:16 -> 02:40:16:  Okay. (-0.4575394850510817)

02:40:32 -> 02:40:35:  I'm struggling to understand this question. (-0.4889346531459263)
02:40:42 -> 02:40:47:  I wish public life was less tangled up in all those stimuli. (-0.25024285956994813)
02:40:47 -> 02:40:50:  Do I wish public life was less tangled up? (-0.25024285956994813)
02:40:51 -> 02:40:52:  I guess I do. (-0.25024285956994813)
02:40:52 -> 02:40:53:  I do. (-0.25024285956994813)
02:40:53 -> 02:40:53:  I do. (-0.25024285956994813)
02:40:53 -> 02:40:54:  I would rather it not. (-0.25024285956994813)
02:40:55 -> 02:40:57:  I would rather do things and sit around analyzing them. (-0.25024285956994813)
02:41:01 -> 02:41:03:  Most of my analysis is done in the shower. (-0.18789632203149015)
02:41:03 -> 02:41:05:  Most of my thinking is done in bed or in the shower. (-0.18789632203149015)
02:41:08 -> 02:41:16:  I would say I have a pretty...  I would say I have a pretty level distribution of when I do things and when I analyze things. (-0.18789632203149015)
02:41:24 -> 02:41:26:  I like some advertising when it's like targeted. (-0.24086284637451172)
02:41:27 -> 02:41:29:  Because what is the point in not liking advertising? (-0.24086284637451172)
02:41:29 -> 02:41:30:  Right? (-0.24086284637451172)
02:41:30 -> 02:41:33:  Like you're not gonna be able to stop it. (-0.24086284637451172)
02:41:33 -> 02:41:36:  Advertising is just gonna get in your face way worse. (-0.24086284637451172)
02:41:37 -> 02:41:40:  So what is the point in getting upset about it? (-0.24086284637451172)
02:41:41 -> 02:41:44:  It's only going to keep getting worse. (-0.24086284637451172)
02:41:47 -> 02:41:48:  I mean I have adblock. (-0.3287449602810842)
02:41:48 -> 02:41:51:  Look I literally have adblock in my browser. (-0.3287449602810842)
02:42:01 -> 02:42:06:  But like I don't like it when it's like in...  When it like interrupts my content. (-0.3287449602810842)
02:42:07 -> 02:42:07:  I guess. (-0.3287449602810842)
02:42:11 -> 02:42:15:  I block ads whenever I can and I will Fed post against advertisers. (-0.2651245948111657)
02:42:16 -> 02:42:18:  But look as a company right? (-0.2651245948111657)
02:42:18 -> 02:42:23:  As a company you have to look...  You have to look at this from like a seller's perspective. (-0.2651245948111657)
02:42:23 -> 02:42:24:  It's because you're a consumer. (-0.2651245948111657)
02:42:24 -> 02:42:26:  If you look at it from a seller's perspective. (-0.2651245948111657)
02:42:27 -> 02:42:30:  You would also advertise to make your business be more known. (-0.2651245948111657)
02:42:31 -> 02:42:31:  Right? (-0.2651245948111657)
02:42:31 -> 02:42:36:  So they are paying money.  They're paying money to advertise their business to you. (-0.2651245948111657)
02:42:36 -> 02:42:37:  Because they think that you will like it. (-0.38503603501753375)
02:42:43 -> 02:42:46:  We as FaZe also does ads. (-0.38503603501753375)
02:42:46 -> 02:42:46:  Right? (-0.38503603501753375)
02:42:48 -> 02:42:48:  So. (-0.38503603501753375)
02:42:50 -> 02:42:52:  And because of some ads. (-0.24437676189101745)
02:42:52 -> 02:42:54:  Because of some of the ads you've discovered. (-0.24437676189101745)
02:42:55 -> 02:42:55:  FaZe. (-0.24437676189101745)
02:42:56 -> 02:42:57:  Not on seller's side so I don't care. (-0.24437676189101745)
02:42:57 -> 02:43:00:  But you have to look at it from as many angles as possible. (-0.24437676189101745)
02:43:00 -> 02:43:01:  You can't just be close-minded. (-0.24437676189101745)
02:43:01 -> 02:43:03:  And only look at it from your consumer angle. (-0.24437676189101745)
02:43:04 -> 02:43:05:  Because everybody is different. (-0.24437676189101745)
02:43:05 -> 02:43:09:  And everybody has a different...  Like a different need. (-0.24437676189101745)
02:43:09 -> 02:43:09:  A different goal. (-0.24437676189101745)
02:43:16 -> 02:43:18:  If I was an advertiser. (-0.25723829636206996)
02:43:18 -> 02:43:19:  I would simply make interesting ads. (-0.25723829636206996)
02:43:19 -> 02:43:20:  That's what I'm talking about. (-0.25723829636206996)
02:43:20 -> 02:43:21:  Interesting ads. (-0.25723829636206996)
02:43:22 -> 02:43:23:  Like their ads are good. (-0.25723829636206996)
02:43:23 -> 02:43:24:  Their ads are bad. (-0.25723829636206996)
02:43:24 -> 02:43:25:  But to reject all ads. (-0.25723829636206996)
02:43:26 -> 02:43:28:  Is a little close-minded. (-0.25723829636206996)
02:43:28 -> 02:43:29:  In my opinion. (-0.25723829636206996)
02:43:30 -> 02:43:31:  I do have ad blocker. (-0.25723829636206996)
02:43:31 -> 02:43:33:  Because I don't like it when ads are invasive. (-0.25723829636206996)
02:43:36 -> 02:43:38:  But when they're not invasive. (-0.25723829636206996)
02:43:38 -> 02:43:39:  I think they're fine. (-0.3076593447954227)

02:54:21 -> 02:54:23:  But I don't feel awkward when people say I look nice. (-0.2858466018329967)

02:54:58 -> 02:55:00:  What you're saying to be used against you. (-0.23617643468520222)
02:55:00 -> 02:55:04:  But it doesn't really matter because you already know what I'm thinking and I've already played Dustborn. (-0.23617643468520222)
02:55:04 -> 02:55:05:  So what? (-0.23617643468520222)

02:55:46 -> 02:55:48:  Which is more often true of you. (-0.22314630705734778)
02:55:50 -> 02:55:54:  Someone asks me a question doesn't give me enough time to think of an answer before they resume talking. (-0.22314630705734778)
02:55:54 -> 02:55:58:  I ask someone a question and get impatient when they don't match my conversational pace. (-0.5272743020738874)

02:56:49 -> 02:56:51:  Maybe something unexpected will come along. (-0.3383292680905189)
02:56:57 -> 02:56:58:  Hmm. (-0.3383292680905189)

02:59:37 -> 02:59:37:  Oops. (-0.27053916815555457)
