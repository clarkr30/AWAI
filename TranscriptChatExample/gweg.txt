Do I have a cock fetish? What the hell do you guys even mean? What are you even talking about? What are you guys even talking about? 

Hint of cuckness
 But instead of your lungs becoming black, it's your brain. Rotting and melting into a goopy... Into a goopy, disgusting puddle of flesh and blood. Dang it, eagle. Hint of cockness.  What? What?

I think you guys can be pretty funny sometimes. 

I recommend you listening to Break Up In A Small Town from Sam Hunt. It's about a guy getting NTR by his circles of friends.
 No? You think shipping is like a...  Is like a woman thing? I recommend you listening to Break Up in a Small Town from Sam Hunt? I don't want to listen to...  I don't want to listen to an NTR song. Yeah. It's a woman thing. Shipping is a woman thing. Today...  Today I learned. Today I learned. Not nearly as crazy. Ruby and Aqua are my favorite ship. That's pretty funny.

Anyone who said they never shipped anyone and is a male is a god damn liar never trust them, they ship women all the time 
 Who do I even ship? Who do I even ship? Anyone who said they've never shipped anyone is a male and is a goddamn liar. Never trust them. They ship women all the time. Is that true chat? Chat.

Yeah, I mean...  Why would I say things that are...  Why would I say...  A bunch of comments that are...  In...  Support of me. Right? A lot of us don't have any friends now. We know... I guess this applies a lot less to, like...  Real situations. It's like...  It's like fictional situations. Like anime. I mean, I'm totally hypocritical for saying this. Because I used to...  I used to do the same thing. But...  But yeah. At least I don't push canonically gay. You know. Those people have nothing else to live for. And no real life friendships. I don't know. I just really like...  I just really like looking at things.  That makes me angry. I just really like looking at... Like...  It's like...  I'm not actually like...  It's not actually like...  My day is like ruined.

But I'm a woman every day. It's not special. A monkey! A successful CEO. 

If you need a horror game suggestion, Voices of the Void I think would be up your alley
 Don't go to Paris. Why? But it's a city of romance. It's a place of romance. People propose under the Eiffel Tower all the time. Voices of the Void, I think, would be up your alley. That sounds interesting. Voices of the Void. I'll think about it. Jelly, who was it? You're not going to get me to say it. Nice try. You're not going to get me to say it. I'm literally white as a sheet. You cannot get me to say it, bro. It's literally suicide. It's carrier suicide. Okay. Anyways. I was talking about...  I was talking about...  I was talking about...  Couples, okay? Couples in Paris. You're cool, my love? Thank you, Statici, for 10 months.

Praise Dear Leader Jerry, Accept Our Outer Space Overlord #Not A Jult
 Dealing with people can be unpleasant...  But people themselves can never be awful or horrible. No way. Some people are just born...  Born...  Born bad. Thank you so much, super! No way, dude. People are...  Some people are literally just bad to the core. Which is more true of you. I've been known to let administrative things...  Like insurance and tax returns...  Fall through the cracks. I'm somewhat compulsive...  About staying on top of administrative things...  Like insurance and tax returns. What does this mean? Like I do my taxes...  And I do administrative things...  Like insurance. This is...  This means I forget to do them...  And this means I... This means I...  This means I forget...  And this means I don't forget... Jelly, do you think some people are better than others? 

Jelly, do you think some people are better than others?
 This means I...  This means I forget...  And this means I don't forget... Jelly, do you think some people are better than others? Yeah, straight up. They're just born different. You pay your bills on time. Yeah, the first. All the time. I would rather be familiar and conversant...  With all manner of different ideas... Or pursue a select few ideas...  Or interests...  Until I feel like...  Feel that I have mastered them...  All the way from top to bottom. I guess this...  I'm good at...  I like to be versatile. I like to be versatile. Hi, how's it going? I'm good, man. I'm just doing the murderous villain test...  Because somebody in chat told me to. 

You could just ask Fishman and tell him it's business expenses and have Phase shipped it to your doorstep.
 I move at a very fast pace. To make sure I don't get bored. I move at a deliberate pace. To make sure I can concentrate. Thank you. But that's not the problem. That's not the problem here. The problem is. The problem is. The problem is. The problem is. Me. The problem is. I would rather read a book about philosophy. Do you know how little that narrows it down? What do you mean? What do you mean by that?  Just request like five plushies so they won't know who is the actual one. 

just request like 5 plushies so they won't know who is the actual one 
 What do you mean? What do you mean by that?  Just request like five plushies so they won't know who is the actual one. I'll think about it. I'll think about it.  I'm getting a middleman. It's pretty good. It's a pretty good... Yeah, getting a middleman is pretty good. Okay. Why would I read a book about sports? I don't care about sports. Which is more true of you. Sometimes things aren't really true for me until I've read them in a book. Sometimes things aren't really true for me until I've experienced them myself. The best guide to human action is principles. Otherwise, people could justify anything. Values. It is important to be authentic about who you are. What is principles and what is values? Truth? Worth? Wait, what? Isn't this the same thing? Judgment? 

oh before I forget, are you planning to play more awful games with cringe writing like dragon age veilguard
 Worth? Wait, what? Isn't this the same thing? Judgment? Principles or rules? Okay. Rules are crazy important. Thank you, Sanake for the soup.  What? I'm trying to play more awful games with cringe writing like Dragon Age Veil Guard. You know, flaming games publicly on stream? Completely transparent here. But flaming games publicly on stream is not that great for a streamer.  Because, especially a streamer my size. Because it's basically...  I don't know. I think... I think... It... Is a bad look. For sponsorships? And I kind of want sponsorships. So I don't...  I would rather not like, you know, blow myself up. Old school ads are at least funny. Now they're dull and preachy. One after the other. Over and over. Makes me want to avoid the brand. Thank you for the soupa. Makes sense. Yeah, it makes me a brand risk. And I'm...  I'm under face connect, right? 

Old School Ads were at least funny, Now they are Dull and Preachy, One After the Other, Over and Over, Makes me want avoid that Brand Bcuz F Them
 Because it's basically...  I don't know. I think... I think... It... Is a bad look. For sponsorships? And I kind of want sponsorships. So I don't...  I would rather not like, you know, blow myself up. Old school ads are at least funny. Now they're dull and preachy. One after the other. Over and over. Makes me want to avoid the brand. Thank you for the soupa. Makes sense. Yeah, it makes me a brand risk. And I'm...  I'm under face connect, right? I don't...  I wouldn't want to like...  I wouldn't want to...  I wouldn't want to ruin anything. You know? In general, I think that more of society as well should be taxed from the rich and... 

its ok when a women does it 
 I ask someone a question and get impatient when they don't match my conversational pace. Dang it, I ate of a suma. It's okay when a woman does it. Like what, murder? I don't...  I don't...  I don't...  I don't... None of this is true. This is not...  None of this is true. Philosophy is kind of pointless. Yeah. People are generally oversensitive and tend to make big fusses over things that don't really matter. So true. No! When solving a problem, I prefer to... Steer directly towards accomplishing the goal and bringing the task to completion. Or keep my options open. Maybe something unexpected will come along.

i'd let you final solution me 
 Demanded a level of efficiency and work ethic of others  that they might not have been capable of delivering  which was not natural to them? Oops. Use their natural leadership and organizational skills  to claim the man to assert yourself as leader of something  without making sure that this was in accordance  of the wishes of the other parties involved. Okay, not yet. Exhibited intense loyalty to your friends and family  and put your resources and cunning to the work of aiding them  even when they might not have deserved it. Actually, close. I've been so frustrated with the lack of definitive closure  in a situation that you acted rashly and forced a conclusion  even though it might not have been the one you desired. Oops. I let you final solution me. Awesome. More energetic and quicker to act? Someone who has a greater number of friends than the average person? I would say acquaintances. Actually, no, dude.
